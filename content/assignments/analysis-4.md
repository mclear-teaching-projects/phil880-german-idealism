## Passage 1 {#passage-1}

> Logic, on the contrary, cannot presuppose any of these forms of reﬂection,
> these rules and laws of thinking, for they are part of its content and they
> ﬁrst have to be established within it. And it is not just the declaration of
> scientiﬁc method but the concept itself of science as such that belongs to
> its content and even makes up its ﬁnal result. Logic, therefore, cannot say
> what it is in advance, rather does this knowledge of itself only emerge as
> the ﬁnal result and completion of its whole treatment. Likewise its subject
> matter, thinking or more speciﬁcally conceptual thinking, is essentially
> elaborated within it; its concept is generated in the course of this
> elaboration and cannot therefore be given in advance. What is anticipated in
> this Introduction, therefore, is not intended to ground as it were the
> concept of logic, or to justify in advance its content and method
> scientiﬁcally, but rather to make more intuitable, by means of some
> explanations and reﬂections of an argumentative and historical nature, the
> standpoint from which this science ought to be considered. (SL 23/21:27-8)


## Passage 2 {#passage-2}

> science, insofar as it comes onto the scene, is itself an appearance;
> science’s coming onto the scene is not yet science as it is carried out and
> unfolded in its truth. It makes no difference in this regard whether one
> thinks that science is an appearance because it comes onto the scene
> alongside a kind of knowing that is other than it, or whether one calls that
> other, untrue kind of knowing science’s own appearing. But science must free
> itself from this surface appearance; and it can do so only by turning
> itself against it. For with regard to a knowing that is not truthful,
> science cannot simply reject it as just a common view of things while giving
> out the assurance that it is itself a completely different kind of cognition
> and that that other knowing counts as absolutely nothing for science; nor
> can science appeal to some intimation, contained within that other knowing,
> of something better. Through such an assurance, science declares its being
> to be its power; but untrue knowing just as much appeals to the fact that it
> is, and it gives out the assurance that science counts as nothing to it; but
> one arid assurance is just as valid as another. (PS 51-2/9:55)
