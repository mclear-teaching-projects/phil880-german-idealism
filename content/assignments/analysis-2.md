## First Passage {#first-passage}

> I can freely determine myself to think this or that; for example, the
> thing-in-itself of the dogmatic philosophers. If I now abstract from what is
> thought and observe only myself, I become to myself in this object the content of a
> specific presentation. That I appear to myself to be determined precisely so and
> not otherwise, as thinking, and as thinking, of all possible thoughts, the
> thing-in-itself, should in my opinion depend on my self-determination: I have
> freely made myself into such an object. But I have not made myself as it is in
> itself; on the contrary, I am compelled to presuppose myself as that which is to be
> determined by self-determination. I myself, however, am an object for myself whose
> nature depends, under certain conditions, on the intellect alone, but whose
> existence must always be presupposed. Now the object of idealism is precisely this
> self-in-itself. (1:427)


## Second Passage {#second-passage}

> The self, we say, reverts into itself. So is it not therefore already present for
> itself before the occurrence of this reversion, and independently thereof? Must it
> not already be there for itself, in order that it may make itself the object of an
> act? And if so, doesn&rsquo;t your philosophy in that case already presuppose what it
> was meant to explain? I answer: Not at all. It is only through this act, and first
> by means of it, by an act upon an act itself, which specific act is preceded by no
> other whatever, that the self originally comes to exist for itself. Only for the
> philosopher is it there beforehand, as a fact, since he himself has already run
> through the whole course of experience. He is obliged to express himself as he
> does, if only to be understood; and is able so to express himself, because he has
> already long since acquired all the concepts that are needed for the purpose.
