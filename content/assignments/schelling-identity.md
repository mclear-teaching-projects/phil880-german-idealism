This week we discuss Schelling&rsquo;s Philosophy of Identity. We&rsquo;ll look at further
differences between his view and Fichte&rsquo;s, as well as the ways in which Schelling
adopts elements of Spinozism. Finally, we&rsquo;ll also look at Schelling&rsquo;s conception of
intellectual intuition and its similarities and differences from Kant and Fichte&rsquo;s
notions.
