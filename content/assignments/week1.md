This week we look at the basic structure of Kant&rsquo;s critical project, the issue of
&ldquo;synthetic a priori&rdquo; judgment, Kant&rsquo;s conception of a &ldquo;Copernican revolution&rdquo;
that bases metaphysics on the nature of the faculties of the mind, and his view of
the limits of rational inquiry.
