## <span class="section-num">1</span> First Passage {#first-passage}

> Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to the
> objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a priori through
> concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this presupposition, come to
> nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do not get farther with the problems
> of metaphysics by assuming that the objects must conform to our cognition,
> which would agree better with the requested possibility of an a priori
> cognition of them, which is to establish something about objects before they
> are given to us. This would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus,
> who, when he did not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial
> motions if he assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the
> observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made the
> observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we can try in
> a similar way regarding the intuition of objects. If intuition has to conform
> to the constitution of the objects, then I do not see how we can know anything
> of them a priori; but if the object (as an object of the senses) conforms to
> the constitution of our faculty of intuition, then I can very well represent
> this possibility to myself. Yet because I cannot stop with these intuitions,
> if they are to become cognitions, but must refer them as representations to
> something as their object and determine this object through them, I can assume
> either that the concepts through which I bring about this determination also
> conform to the objects, and then I am once again in the same difficulty about
> how I could know anything about them a priori, or else I assume that the
> objects, or what is the same thing, the experience in which alone they can be
> cognized (as given objects) conforms to those concepts, in which case I
> immediately see an easier way out of the difficulty, since experience itself
> is a kind of cognition requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to
> presuppose in myself before any object is given to me, hence a priori, which
> rule is expressed in concepts a priori, to which all objects of experience
> must therefore necessarily conform, and with which they must agree. As for
> objects insofar as they are thought merely through reason, and necessarily at
> that, but that (at least as reason thinks them) cannot be given in experience
> at all - the attempt to think them (for they must be capable of being thought)
> will provide a splendid touchstone of what we assume as the altered method of
> our way of thinking, namely that we can cognize of things a priori only what
> we ourselves have put into them. (Bxvii-xviii)


## <span class="section-num">2</span> Second Passage {#second-passage}

> There is no doubt whatever that all our cognition begins with experience; for
> how else should the cognitive faculty be awakened into exercise if not through
> objects that stimulate our senses and in part themselves produce
> representations, in part bring the activity of our understanding into motion
> to compare these, to connect or separate them, and thus to work up the raw
> material of sensible impressions into a cognition of objects that is called
> experience? **As far as time is concerned**, then, no cognition in us precedes
> experience, and with experience every cognition begins. But although all our
> cognition commences **with** experience, yet it does not on that account all arise
> **from** experience. For it could well be that even our experiential cognition is
> a composite of that which we receive through impressions and that which our
> own cognitive faculty (merely prompted by sensible impressions) provides out
> of itself, which addition we cannot distinguish from that fundamental material
> until long practice has made us attentive to it and skilled in separating it
> out. It is therefore at least a question requiring closer investigation, and
> one not to be dismissed at first glance, whether there is any such cognition
> independent of all experience and even of all impressions of the senses. One
> calls such **cognitions a priori**, and distinguishes them from **empirical** ones,
> which have their sources _a posteriori_, namely in experience. (B1-2)
