This week we&rsquo;ll start our discussion of Hegel with two readings. The first is from
Hegel&rsquo;s 1802 essay on skepticism. The second is the introduction to his 1807
_Phenomenology of Spirit_. In these texts Hegel criticizes various modes of skepticism
and offers a sketch of a defense of &ldquo;speculative philosophy&rdquo; as a metaphysics of the
absolute.
