We&rsquo;ll look at [Karl Leonhard Reinhold](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/karl-reinhold/)&rsquo;s criticism of the incompleteness of Kant&rsquo;s
critical philosophy and his (Reinhold&rsquo;s) conception of what is needed to complete it.
We&rsquo;ll also look at criticisms of Reinhold&rsquo;s &ldquo;principle of consciousness&rdquo; by Schulze
and Fichte.
