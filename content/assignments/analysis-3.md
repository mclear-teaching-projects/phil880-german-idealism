## Passage 1 {#passage-1}

> The standpoint of philosophy is the standpoint of reason; its kind of
> knowing is a knowing of things as they are in themselves, i.e., as they are
> in reason. It is the nature of philosophy to completely suspend all
> succession and externality, all difference of time and everything which mere
> imagination 15 mingles with thought, in a word, to see in things only that
> aspect by which they express absolute reason. Philosophy, however, does not
> view them insofar as they are objects of reflection, which is subject to the
> laws of mechanism and has duration in time. (DS 346, §1)


## Passage 2 {#passage-2}

> We have left behind everything on which finite understanding is accustomed to
> insist. We have even cut off all return to the realm of the conditioned by our
> declaration that philosophy is entirely and completely in the absolute. After
> all this, it is hardly our intention to allow anything to remain behind which
> we might use to come back to the conditioned. Since this is so, {we face a
> double difficulty}: most people will comprehend neither, in general, how we
> can see so clearly into the absolute that we can ground a science in
> it—although its possibility surely resides in what we have proved before—nor,
> specifically, how we intend to draw material for a science from the simply
> identical and thoroughly simple essence of the absolute. For it will be argued
> that no science is possible of something that is simply one and ever the same,
> that something else is required which is not identical, but multiple and
> differentiated. It will also be argued that even if what is demonstrated be
> forever and necessarily one and the same, by contrast, that in which unity is
> demonstrated is necessarily not one, but many—as happens in geometry, where
> the identical form and absolute unity of space is expressed in the different
> units of triangles, squares, circles, etc. (WD 385, §IV)
