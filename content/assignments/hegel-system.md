As we&rsquo;ve seen thus far, systematicity is a central aspect of German Idealism. Hegel
exemplifies this insofar as he articulates in the _Phenomenology_ an overall conception
of a _system_ of philosophy. We&rsquo;ll read the preface from the _Phenomenology_ as well as
excerpts from the _Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Basic Outline_. Our
aim will be to get a basic sense of his overall view of the system of philosophy, the
structure of metaphysics, and the progression to &ldquo;absolute knowing&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll also
contrast this with Kant&rsquo;s conception of a system of philosophy, and discuss more
generally systematicity as an aim of German Idealism.
