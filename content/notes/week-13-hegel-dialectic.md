In what sense does Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy have a distinctive method? This is a
more difficult question to answer than one might expect, since Hegel is
somewhat (in)famous for his &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo; method of negation.[^fn:1] On the one hand,
Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy seems to reject all assumptions including, presumably,
those of method. On the other hand, Hegel&rsquo;s _Phenomenology_ and _Logic_ both seem
to develop their argument according to a distinctive methodology, and part of
the aim of the _Logic_ is to show, in particular, that the shortcomings of Kant&rsquo;s
Critical method of reflection can be overcome or otherwise avoided.

In what follows I aim to sketch answers to these questions. I discuss the issue
of presupposition, the Fichtean background, and Hegel&rsquo;s conception of
&ldquo;determinate&rdquo; negation. This discussion of method is not a discussion of
dialectic _as such_, e.g., as discussed in the _Encyclopedia_ §§79-82. That will
be discussed in detail separately.


## <span class="section-num">1</span> Method & Presupposition {#method-and-presupposition}

Hegel contends that logic must be presuppositionless:

> if no presupposition is to be made, if the beginning is itself to be taken
> immediately, then the only determination of this beginning is that it is to
> be the beginning of logic, of thought as such. There is only present the
> resolve, which can also be viewed as arbitrary, of considering thinking as
> such. The beginning must then be absolute or, what means the same here, must
> be an abstract beginning; and so there is nothing that it may presuppose,
> must not be mediated by anything or have a ground, ought to be rather itself
> the ground of the entire science. (SL 48/21:56)

Taking the absence of presuppositions seriously raises an immediate problem --
how is the logic to proceed? If logic cannot presuppose anything, then it
cannot presuppose a method in advance of the inquiry, according to which the
logic will proceed.[^fn:2] If that is correct then in what sense is Hegel&rsquo;s
method in the _Logic_ &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo;?

This question is made all the more difficult that attempts to formulate a kind
of general schema in which Hegel makes his arguments tend to wide up in
problems. For example, Forster characterizes Hegel&rsquo;s method as follows:[^fn:3]

> Beginning from a category A, Hegel seeks to show that upon conceptual
> analysis, category A proves to contain a _contrary_ category, B, and
> conversely that category B proves to contain category A, thus showing both
> categories to be self-contradictory. He then seeks to show that this
> negative result has a positive outcome, a new category, C (sometimes
> referred to as the &ldquo;negative of the negative&rdquo; or the &ldquo;determinate
> negation&rdquo;). This new category unites - as Hegel puts it - the preceding
> categories A and B. That is to say, when analyzed the new category is found
> to contain them both. But it unites them in such a way that they are not
> only preserved but also abolished (to use Hegel&rsquo;s term of art for this
> paradoxical-sounding process, they are _aufgehoben_). That is to say, they are
> preserved or contained in the new category only with their original senses
> modified. This modification of their senses renders them no longer
> self-contradictory (and not a source of self-contradiction in the new
> category that contains them both). That is because it renders them no longer
> contraries, and therefore no longer self-contradictory in virtue of their
> reciprocal containment. At this point, one level of the dialectic has been
> completed, and we pass to a new level where category C plays the role that
> was formerly played by category A.1\* And so on. Hegel understand each step
> of this whole process to be necessary.

This perhaps describes _some_ of Hegel&rsquo;s discussions of dialectic, but it is not
at all clear that it captures all of them, or even all the core uses. For that
reason, among others, it has remained controversial.[^fn:4]

One point, emphasized by Houlgate among others, is that Hegel does not
presuppose a dialectical process, but _discovers_ it in the process of his
argument in the _Logic_. William Maker presents this position rather
emphatically when he writes:[^fn:5]

> [T]aking &rsquo;method&rsquo; to denote a specific and specifiable set of rules of
> procedure as operational or cognitive principles for the consideration of a
> given subject matter ... [then i]nsofar as method is that which can–even if
> only in principle–be justified, formulated or learned in abstraction from
> the subject matter to which it is to be applied, Hegel does not have a
> method. Insofar as &rsquo;method&rsquo; is taken to be a significant term only in and
> through a contrast with some content for which the method is designed and to
> which it is applied, Hegel does not have a method. Insofar as a method
> constitutes a given or theoretically derivable principle or set of
> principles in terms of which a subject matter is thought or considered,
> Hegel does not have a method. Insofar as one can speak of there being, in
> the sense just outlined, a phenomenological method, a scientific method, a
> transcendental method, an analytical method, a speculative method and so on,
> Hegel does not have a method.

So Hegel does not have a &rsquo;method&rsquo; in any sense that presupposes a given
principle or process of derivation that is independent of the content to which
the method is applied. But this isn&rsquo;t to say that there is _no_ method to the
argument of the _Logic_:

> How could I possibly pretend that the method that I follow in this system of
> logic, or rather the method that this system itself follows within, would
> not be capable of greater perfection, of greater elaboration of detail? Yet
> I know that it is the one and only true method. This is made obvious by the
> very fact that this method is not something distinct from its subject matter
> and content – for it is the content in itself, _the dialectic which it
> possesses within itself_, which moves the subject matter forward. It is clear
> that no expositions can be accepted as scientiﬁcally valid that do not
> follow the progression of this method and are not in tune with its simple
> rhythm, for it is the course of the fact itself. (SL 33/21:38)

Hegel&rsquo;s point here seems to be that, at least in the case of the _Logic_, there
is no method apart from the content of the _Logic_ itself. This raises several
questions though. First, can we expect that the method, whatever it is (i.e.
whatever exactly is meant by the phrase &ldquo;the dialectic which it possesses
within itself&rdquo;) will be the same throughout the _Logic_? Second, is the method
in the _Logic_ going to be transferable to other parts of Hegel&rsquo;s system?
Answering these question will partly determine (or be determined by) how we
construe Hegel&rsquo;s overall system. To see how to answer these questions, it is
helpful to first take a detour through Fichte&rsquo;s Jena philosophical project and
its conception of a &ldquo;synthetic&rdquo; method.


## <span class="section-num">2</span> The Fichtean Background {#the-fichtean-background}

In the course of articulating the basic structure of his science of
knowledge, Fichte presents three steps or phases. In the first the pure or
absolute subject is posited; in the second, the &ldquo;not-self&rdquo; is posited in
opposition to the subject or &ldquo;I&rdquo;. At this point Fichte acknowledges a problem:
the conclusions concerning the subject and the &ldquo;not-subject&rdquo; to which it is
opposed are in contradiction.

> The second principle annuls itself [_hebt sich auf_]; and it also does not
> annul itself. If this is how things stand with the second principle, it
> cannot be otherwise with the first as well. It annuls itself and also does
> not annul itself. For, if I = I, everything is posited that is posited in the
> self. But now the second principle is supposed to be posited in the self, and
> also not to be posited therein. Thus I does not = I, but rather self =
> not-self, and not-self = self. (GWL 1:106-7)

Fichte contends here that the absolute subject, in positing itself, is also
opposed to itself (as the &ldquo;not-self&rdquo; or &ldquo;object&rdquo; pole of its own
self-consciousness). This might seem to lead to a contradiction and, in that
sense, a dissolution or nihilism of rational activity.

Obviously this is a problem. Fichte could reject one or the other of the
principles he has articulated, but he takes them to be mutually implicating.
So if Fichte is not to reject this starting point for his system he must
demonstrate that this contradiction can be resolved, or is otherwise, merely
apparent. As he puts it,

> All these conclusions have been derived from the principles already set
> forth, according to laws of reflection that we have presupposed as valid; so
> they must be correct. But if they are correct, then the identity of
> consciousness, the sole absolute foundation of our knowledge, is itself
> nullified [_aufgehoben_]. And now our task is hereby determined. For we have
> to discover some X, by means of which all these conclusions can be granted
> as correct, without nullifying the identity of consciousness. (GWL 1:107)

So Fichte contends here that there is some further concept within which the
contradiction or opposition between the self and not-self can be resolved. In
fact, what Fichte presents are a series of concepts, including <reality>,
<negation>, <limit> (which contains the two prior), and <divisibility> (which
contains all three prior concepts). The putative contradiction (annihilation)
of the I and not-I is resolved by construing them as mutually limiting one
another. The I and the not-I must both be seen as “divisible” (GWL 1:108–9).
They are each in part different from each other, and yet in part also the same
as or equal to (_gleich_) each other.

The synthetic method of reasoning is genuinely _productive_ of the new concept.
Fichte asserts that &ldquo;I must not be understood to maintain that the idea of a
limit is an analytical concept, inherent in the combination of reality and
negation, and capable of being evolved from this&rdquo; (GWL 1:108). This synthesis
thus involves “discovering in opposites the respect in which they are alike”
(GWL 1:112–13). So, from an original identity, opposition is derived, which
threatens a contradiction that that is then resolved in the positing of a new
concept in which a new (partial) identity is discovered. According to Fichte,
this resolution of contradiction through the synthesis of opposites in a new
concept is necessary for all scientific knowledge. As he says of the move from
the contradiction between self and not-self to the synthetic concept of
divisibility,

> there can be no further question as to the possibility of this [synthesis],
> nor can any ground for it be given; it is absolutely possible, and we are
> entitled to it without further grounds of any kind. (GWL 1:114)

Fichte here states that concepts introduced in this way are ones to which &ldquo;we
are entitled&rdquo;. Moreover, such concepts are introduced without appeal to
anything empirical. They are concepts necessary to avoid contradiction, in the
explanation of the possibility of experience (and in particular the
self-positing ego and its activity). In Kant&rsquo;s terminology then, Fichte
provides through the synthetic method a &ldquo;metaphysical deduction&rdquo; of our
concepts, insofar as their content is derived from non-empirical content. The
method also provides a &ldquo;transcendental deduction&rdquo; of the concepts, insofar as
the instantiation of such concepts is necessary for experience. Such concepts
are also made _determinate_, in that their content is defined to the extent
necessary to avoid contradiction.[^fn:1]

This _synthetic_ method is importantly different from the _analytical_ method (of
analyzing given concepts into their components), which also leads to
oppositions or contradictions. Fichte claims that with the analytic method “we
not only do not get very far, as Kant says; we do not get anywhere at all”
(GWL 1:113). The analytic method does not generate _new_ concepts/content, or
new identity relations, but merely generates concepts/content that are already
present in the content of the concept(s) being analyzed or thought. This means
that in the case of a contradiction generated through mere conceptual
analysis, there is no positive result---i.e. there is no content generated,
and no further concept in which these opposed concepts can be resolved. In
contrast, the synthetic method enables us to move beyond contradiction and
thus avoid being left with nothing (at least from the perspective of reason).
In this sense the synthetic method brings forth some new positive content
(e.g. of <limit> or <divisibility> by means of a negation of the old content.

Fichte&rsquo;s synthetic method is clearly the basis for Hegel&rsquo;s own. But it is not
_identical_ with Hegel&rsquo;s characterization of the &ldquo;movement&rdquo; of the concept.
Several points are worth noting here.

First, Fichte _begins_ his philosophy with the self-positing subject. But such a
beginning violates Hegel&rsquo;s no presuppositions rule, for it simply _assumes_ that
thought takes the form of first-personal thinking. Second, while Fichte
characterizes his synthetic method in terms of an interaction between thesis,
antithesis, and synthesis (GWL 1:123-5), it is not clear that this is true for
Hegel. Certainly, _some_ of Hegel&rsquo;s arguments take this form (e.g. in the
dialectic of <being>–<nothing>-<becoming>) but not all do.[^fn:6] Third, and
perhaps most importantly for our purposes, Fichte fails to adequately explain
how it is that _new_ content is generated through the synthetic method. We&rsquo;ve
seen that Fichte clearly rejects the idea that the synthetic method is a
simple &ldquo;unpacking&rdquo; of the prior content of a concept. For Fichte, as for Kant,
there is no analysis without a prior synthesis. But then what is the source of
this _new_ content. For Kant, a synthetic judgment either had its new content
based in sensory experience (in intuition), or based in the conscious
apprehension of some structure that is inherent in the mind&rsquo;s own activity.
Fichte seems to intend something like the latter when he says,

> we can infer the synthesis; and can equally establish the third thing, in
> which the two opposites are united, not as a product of reflection, but as
> something discovered thereby. It is, however, a product of that original
> synthetic act of the self, and as an act, can thus no more attain to empirical
> consciousness than can the acts already postulated. (GWL 1:124)

So the content is to be traced to the acts of the absolute (self-positing)
subject. But then if we reject (as Hegel does) the contention that thought
must be presupposed as the activity of such a subject, then we cannot explain
the source or origin of the content in terms of the acts of such a subject.

Hence, given Hegel&rsquo;s rejection of Fichte&rsquo;s starting point, his method (such as
it is) in the _Logic_ requires a different explanation of how content
originates. This involves two important Hegelian ideas. The first is that
thought exhibits &ldquo;movement&rdquo; (_Bewegung_); the second is that such movement takes
the form of what Hegel calls &ldquo;determinate negation&rdquo; (_bestimmte Negation_)


## <span class="section-num">3</span> Thought&rsquo;s Movement {#thought-and-rsquo-s-movement}

Recall that Hegel construes the method of the _Logic_ as inseparable from its
content: &ldquo;this method is not something distinct from its subject matter and
content – for it is the content in itself, _the dialectic which it possesses
within itself_, which moves the subject matter forward&rdquo; (SL 33; 21:38). But
what does it mean to say that thought &ldquo;moves&rdquo; in this manner, or that it is
internally &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo; in a sense that is generative?

Hegel&rsquo;s view is that each concept of the _Logic_ is internally inconsistent in a
way that drives the activity of thinking that concept towards the development
of a new concept that is not inconsistent in the relevant way. As Hegel puts
it, &ldquo;what is to be considered as method here [i.e. in the _Logic_] is only the
movement of the concept itself&rdquo; (SL 737; 12:238). Likewise, he says,

> What propels the concept onward is the already mentioned negative which it
> possesses in itself; it is this that constitutes the truly dialectical
> factor. _Dialectic_, once considered a separate part of logic and, one may
> say, entirely misunderstood so far as its purpose and standpoint are
> concerned, thereby assumes a totally different position. (SL 34/21:39-40)

In contrast to Kant, who considers the use of reason to generate concepts
(&ldquo;ideas&rdquo;) through the process of seeking conditions for any given conditioned
judgment or object as inherently self-undermining when applied in an unlimited
manner, Hegel considers reason as able to generate new and ever more
determinately adequate concepts through the process of presenting, and then
overcoming, apparent contradictions (or perhaps &ldquo;oppositions&rdquo; is better here).

But in order for there to be such an &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of dynamic production, it has to
be the case that the &ldquo;negation&rdquo; of a concept by its opposite is itself a
productive kind of opposition, rather than one that simply leads to an end to
thought. We can see this problem clearly as presented by Kant, who says that,

> the proposition that no predicate pertains to a thing that contradicts it is
> called the principle of contradiction, and is a general though merely
> negative criterion of all truth, but on that account it also belongs merely
> to logic, since it holds of cognitions merely as cognitions in general,
> without regard to their content, and says that contradiction entirely
> annihilates and cancels them [_gänzlich vernichte und aufhebe_] (A151/B190)
>
> that no cognition can be opposed to [the principle of contradiction] without
> annihilating itself [_ohne sich selbst zu vernichten_] certainly makes this
> principle into a _conditio sine qua non_, but not into a determining ground of
> the truth of our cognition. (A151-2/B191)

Thus, in Kant&rsquo;s view, contradiction leads to the &ldquo;annihilation&rdquo; of thought
itself. Hegel (like Fichte) rejects this position. Contradiction doesn&rsquo;t end
the activity of thinking, but produces new thought (i.e. is productive of
genuinely novel content for thinking). Hegel&rsquo;s name for this sort of
productive opposition is &ldquo;determinate negation&rdquo;.

Hegel&rsquo;s notion of determinate negation appears in a number of places. For
example, in the _Phenomenology_ he says,

> Skepticism which ends with the abstraction of nothingness or emptiness
> cannot progress any further from this point, but must instead wait to see
> whether something new will present itself and what it will be, in order that
> it can also toss it into the same empty abyss. By contrast, while the result
> is grasped as it is in truth, as _determinate_ negation, a new form has
> thereby immediately arisen, and in the negation, the transition is made
> whereby the progression through the complete series of shapes comes about on
> its own accord. (PS 53/9:57; see also EL §81)

Here we see Hegel characterize a _new_ shape of consciousness as the determinate
negation of a prior one. Determinate negation is thus _productive_ of its
content. We see this very clearly also in Hegel&rsquo;s statement in the _Logic_ that,

> [t]he one thing needed to _achieve scientific progress_ – and it is essential
> to make an effort at gaining this quite _simple_ insight into it – is [i] the
> recognition of the logical principle that negation is equally positive, or
> that what is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into
> abstract nothingness, but essentially only into [ii] the negation of its
> _particular_ content; or [iii] that such a negation is not just negation, but
> is the _negation of the determined fact_ which is resolved, and is therefore
> determinate negation; that [iv] in the result there is therefore contained
> in essence that from which the result derives – [v] a tautology indeed,
> since the result would otherwise be something immediate and not a result.
> Because the result, the negation, is a _determinate_ negation, it has a
> _content_. [vi] It is a new concept but one higher and richer than the
> preceding – [vii] richer because it negates or opposes the preceding and
> therefore contains it, and it [viii] contains even more than that, for it is
> the unity of itself and its opposite. – [ix] It is above all in this way
> that the system of concepts is to be to erected – and [x] it has to come to
> completion in an unstoppable and pure progression that admits of nothing
> extraneous. (SL 33/21:38)

There is a lot to unpack here. I&rsquo;ve added roman numerals in brackets to better
discuss the set of claims being made.

Hegel says first that we must recognize &ldquo;the logical principle that negation
is equally positive&rdquo;, and that this is what is needed to achieve progress in
science. I take Hegel not to be making a general point about negation _as such_,
but rather a specific point about negation as found in what is
&ldquo;self-contradictory&rdquo;.[^fn:7] Moreover, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that Hegel is here
speaking of _any_ contradiction we can generate, but rather of (self-)contradictions in
specific determinate conceptual categories.[^fn:8] This reading of (i) is
supported by the claims made in (ii) and (iii) -- viz. we don&rsquo;t simply have
negation, but rather the negation of a self-contradictory content that
thereby resolves into a new content.

Hegel then contends (iv) that this new content also contains the old content,
though in a way that is no longer self-contradictory. Hegel speaks of this as
(v) &ldquo;tautological&rdquo; because to speak of the &ldquo;result&rdquo; of such negation, or of its
being &ldquo;derived&rdquo;, a &ldquo;consequence of&rdquo;, or &ldquo;following from&rdquo; the original concept
is to see its content as related to the previous content in question. If it
did not satisfy these conditions then it would simply be an immediately
posited content.

Thus Hegel does indeed seem to construe the dialectical activity of thought as
generative of new content in a manner that might be described as &ldquo;inference&rdquo;,
since there is a kind of derivation or following-from between new and old
content. But such dialectical inferences are not the same as those we see in
classical syllogistic reasoning, where there is a derivation of content in the
conclusion, but via a kind of subsumtive process or activity. Here it is
perhaps of use to take a brief excursus on Kant&rsquo;s conception of reason and
inference, as a contrast to the sense of &ldquo;derived content&rdquo; that Hegel is
utilizing in the _Logic_.


### <span class="section-num">3.1</span> Kant on Reasoning and Results {#kant-on-reasoning-and-results}

Kant characterizes an _immediate_ inference is one in which a thinker moves
_directly_ from one judgment _A_ to another _C_, while a _mediate_ inference requires
an further intermediary judgment _B_ to license the transition from _A_ to _C_. Kant
is represented as holding this position quite clearly in the _Jäsche Logik_:

> An **immediate** inference (_consequentia immediata_) is the derivation
> (_deductio_) of one judgment from the other without a mediating
> judgment (_judicium intermedium_). An inference is **mediate** if,
> besides the concept that a judgment contains in itself, one needs
> still others in order to derive a cognition from it. (9:114)

Kant characterizes immediate inference as carried out by the
understanding, and as only involving a change in the form, rather than
the matter, of a proposition. For example, Kant characterizes the
transition from the judgment &ldquo;All men are mortal&rdquo; to the judgment &ldquo;Some
men are mortal&rdquo; as an immediate inference (JL 9: 115).

Mediate inferences require three judgments, two of which are mediated by
a third, and Kant represents this mediation as structured according to
the traditional framework provided by Aristotelian syllogistic logic.
Hence, Kant considers the variety of forms of Aristotelian syllogism as
limning the structure of mediate inference as such.

Aristotelian syllogistic inference connects three judgments: a premise (the
&ldquo;minor&rdquo; premise) together with a conclusion via a mediating second premise or
rule (the &ldquo;major&rdquo; premise). The predicate of the conclusion is the &ldquo;major&rdquo;
term, and the premise that contains it the &ldquo;major&rdquo; premise. The subject of the
conclusion is the &ldquo;minor&rdquo; term, and likewise the premise containing it the
&ldquo;minor&rdquo; premise. The term common to the two premises is the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; term. The
major premise thus establishes a relation between the concepts constituting
the minor premise and those constituting the conclusion via the assertion of
the middle term. Consider one of Kant&rsquo;s many well-worn examples:

1.  All men are mortal [Major -- All As are Bs]
2.  Caius is a man [Minor -- Some C is A]
3.  &there4; Caius is mortal [Conclusion -- Some C is B]

One thing to note here is that to say that there is a mediate inference
above from (1) to (3) is _not_ to say that there is a succession of
immediate inferences from (1) to (2) and (2) to (3).[^fn:9] This distinction
does not specify why Kant would separate the activity of understanding and
reason in the way that he does.[^fn:10] Indeed, Hegel tends to characterize
what Kant calls &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; as rather activity of the understanding, or at
best, of &ldquo;dialectical reason&rdquo;, but not of &ldquo;speculative reason&rdquo;, which is (for
Hegel) the faculty by which we come to comprehend the unity of such finite
forms of opposition.[^fn:11]

For Kant, a sufficient condition of distinguishing between immediate and
mediate inference is that immediate inference involves only a change in the
&rsquo;form&rsquo; rather than the &rsquo;matter&rsquo; of the judgments (e.g. change of quantity from
&rsquo;all crows are black&rsquo; to &rsquo;some crows are black&rsquo;). The mediate inference above,
however, includes a change in matter. In the transition from (1) to (2) there
is a change of matter with the introduction of the new content concerning
Caius. The fact that there is a change of matter in this way is sufficient for
its counting as a &rsquo;mediate&rsquo; inference.

Going back to our toy example from above, and assuming that it is analytic
that humans are mortal, we can see that assertion of the subject term &ldquo;human&rdquo;
is sufficient to explain an assertion of the predicate term &ldquo;mortal&rdquo; in the
judgment &ldquo;Caius is mortal.&rdquo; The minor premise subsumes a particular
(designated by &ldquo;Caius&rdquo;) under this condition, thus allowing one to assert, of
_Caius_, that he is also mortal.

So the truth of the conclusion of Kant&rsquo;s toy example---i.e. that Caius is
mortal---is necessitated by the premises in the sense that their assertion is
sufficient for the conclusion to be true. In this sense, Kant considers the
syllogism to be a depiction or representation of _why_ &ldquo;Caius is mortal&rdquo; is
true.

Thus when Kant says that in reasoning (in the narrow sense) &ldquo;I determine my
cognition through the predicate of the rule (the _conclusio_), hence _a priori_
through **reason**&rdquo; (A304/B360-1) he means that it is through reason (as opposed
to understanding or judgment) that the mind is able to represent the truth of
the conclusion (itself a cognition) rather than its opposite, on the basis of
the assertion of the premises, which thereby necessitate the conclusion. The
connection of reason to &ldquo;determination&rdquo; in this technical sense also explains
Kant&rsquo;s tendency to connect the use of reason with &ldquo;comprehension&rdquo; (_Begreifen_),
which is characterized in the _Jäsche Logik_ as having _insight_ (_Einsicht_) into a
cognition (JL 9:65) sufficient for one&rsquo;s purposes. One has insight just in
case one can represent the sufficient condition of something&rsquo;s being
determinately the case, to the exclusion of its opposite. In the case of
comprehension, this insight need not be perfect or complete, but rather that
which is &ldquo;sufficient for our purpose&rdquo;, whether speculative or practical.

Hegel construes dialectical activity as a kind of _reasoning_, of an activity of
thinking in which one thought is connected (or follows from) another. But he
does not characterize this notion of resulting from a previous thought or
concept as consisting in the kind of subsumptive process Kant discusses above.
The difficulty is stating in positive terms what this process _is_.


### <span class="section-num">3.2</span> Ontology as Ontogeny {#ontology-as-ontogeny}

One clue for understanding Hegel&rsquo;s positive view of dialectical activity is
his statement in the _Encyclopedia_ that,

> Properly construing and recognizing the dialectical dimension is of the
> highest importance. It is in general the principle of all movement, all
> life, and all actual activity. ... life as such carries within itself the
> germ of death and that, generally speaking, the ﬁnite contradicts itself in
> itself and for that reason sublates itself. (EL §81, A1)

As Hegel says here _life_ is a form of dialectical activity. Indeed, such
activity is the principle of &ldquo;all life&rdquo;. If we take Hegel&rsquo;s statement here
(and in other places, e.g. SL 746, 12:246) at face value then in dialectic we
have a kind of _organic activity_, where each new concept or form of thought
follows from the previous, not in the sense of subsuming it (i.e. standing as
a consequent of its sufficient condition, in the sense outlined by Kant), but
as _developing_ it.[^fn:12]

In this sense then, one stage of the dialectic follows from or &ldquo;results&rdquo; from
the previous stage in the sense of developing from it as an oak develops from
an acorn, or a butterfly from a pupa. Moreover, the notion of &ldquo;development&rdquo;
here should be understood in terms of _epigenesis_, which is to say a
spontaneous (in the sense &ldquo;self-driven&rdquo; or &ldquo;self-active&rdquo;) progression of ever
greater articulation and organization, that depends on an internal modulation
of the activity, and manifests a continuous and mutually responsive relation
between parts and whole. This contrasts with _preformationism_, which consider
the articulation and organization of life to be a function of metaphysically
and logically prior parts.[^fn:13] Epigenesis requires a self-organizing power,
or &ldquo;_Bildungskraft_&rdquo;.[^fn:14] I want to briefly describe seven important features of such
development:

1.  Self-organization
2.  (Re)production
3.  Teleological determinacy
4.  Holism
5.  Path dependence
6.  Necessitation
7.  Essential unity

The first point is easy to see, and simply falls out of Hegel&rsquo;s statement of
his &ldquo;method&rdquo;, such as it is, as deriving from &ldquo;the content in itself, _the
dialectic which it possesses within itself_, which moves the subject matter
forward&rdquo; (SL 33; 21:38). There is thus nothing external to thought to which we
advert in explaining its structure and content. Thought is a self-organizing
being.

Returning to our discussion of SL 33/21:38, we see Hegel state the following:

> [vi] It [i.e. the determinate negation or conceptual result of dialectical
> activity] is a new concept but one higher and richer than the preceding –
> [vii] richer because it negates or opposes the preceding and therefore
> contains it (SL 33/21:38)

Here we see Hegel&rsquo;s conception of thought as (re)productive, in the sense that
the novel result of dialectical activity nevertheless &ldquo;contains&rdquo; the previous
content. At times this containment might be quite literal, as in the first
stage of the _Logic_, where <being> and <noting> are content within the concept
<becoming>, and where an epigenetic analogue would be the literal retention of
structure in a later stage of development (as the structure of a human
infant&rsquo;s limbs with respect to its adult maturation). But in other cases the
retention will not be so explicit or literal, as in the case of Hegel&rsquo;s
account of the relation between <concept>, <judgment>, and <syllogism>.[^fn:15]
But again, just as a feature in the life-cycle of an organism (or the
phylogenetic cycle of the species) may be recapitulated in an different form
in a later stage (e.g in the radical transformation from pupa to butterfly) so
too the content of one part of the dialectic may be radically different from
how it appears in another part.

Hegel continues,

> and it [viii] contains even more than that, for it is the unity of itself and
> its opposite. – [ix] It is above all in this way that the system of concepts
> is to be to erected

As we see in (viii) the new content, or &ldquo;result&rdquo;, is richer than the previous
content, but not simply in the sense that it is the _aggregate_ result of
combining the other two contents. Rather it is a _new content_, that
nevertheless retains vestiges of the prior stage. Here again the analogy to
organic development is obvious in that a later stage (e.g. the butterfly, or
the oak) is a _new_ and _richer_ (i.e. more articulated, complex, capable, etc)
stage.

Such a conception suggests that there is at least a weak form of teleology
going on in each stage of the dialectic. This needn&rsquo;t mean that each stage has
some specific end, or even that there is a specific end in view for the
entirety of the dialectical process in the _Logic_. But the transitions between
stages. But the transitions between stages aren&rsquo;t simply unrelated happenings.
Each later stage is a development of the former. Each stage is thus, as
development, _more determinate_ than the prior stage. And insofar as we are
understanding the activity as involving a kind of formative power or drive
(i.e. a _Bildungskraft_ or _Bildungstrieb_) the result of this activity is a kind
of drive towards ever-increasing determinacy. And in positing a
self-organizing, self-determining drive towards increasing (conceptual)
determinacy, we can be assured that a &ldquo;system&rdquo; develops in the sense relevant
to Hegel---viz. an interconnected series of concepts or judgments in a
self-supporting whole that is comprehensive and complete (i.e. captures all
and only the relevant conceptual forms of determinacy). This system gives
intelligibility to its parts---in the case of the _Logic_, stages of conceptual
determinacy. Moreover, each conceptual &ldquo;moment&rdquo; (e.g. each stop in the
activity of dialectic such as <being>, <nothing>, <becoming>, <determinate
being>, etc.) is not itself independent of the whole of which it is a part.
Each content is individuated partly in terms of its relation(s) to other
content.[^fn:16] So the holism is both in the _organization_ of the content (i.e.
the epigenetic progress from lesser to greater determinacy) and in the _nature_
of the content (i.e. in the specific character of each conceptual &ldquo;moment&rdquo;).

Finally, and relatedly, Hegel says,

> and [x] it has to come to completion in an unstoppable and pure progression
> that admits of nothing extraneous. (SL 33/21:38)

With (x) we see again an appeal to teleology, with the notion of a
&ldquo;progression&rdquo; (&ldquo;_vollenden_&rdquo;). But we also see Hegel articulate the last three
related notions of organic, epigenetic, development. These are the _path
dependence_, _necessity_, and _essential unity_ of the activity. Since we have a
progression from lesser to greater determinacy that is &ldquo;unstoppable&rdquo; I take
the progression to be one where each result follows necessarily from the
previous result, and moreoever, in a way that makes each part necessary for
the next (e.g., in the way that an oak tree must first be an acorn). And since
this necessary progression &ldquo;admits of nothing extraneous&rdquo;, it constitutes an
essential unity, one that is complete and, in a sense, could not be other than
it is.[^fn:17]

We see this appeal to a kind of essentialism in the development of the _Logic_
in Hegel&rsquo;s characterization of its starting point: &ldquo;It thus lies in the _nature
of a beginning itself_ that it should be being and nothing else&rdquo; (SL 50/21:59).
Similarly, Hegel talks of the _Logic_ as concerned with &ldquo;thinking as such&rdquo; (SL
41/21:47), and in the _Encyclopedia_ Hegel says,

> The realization that the dialectic makes up the very nature of thinking and
> that as understanding it is bound to land in the negative of itself, i.e. in
> contradiction, constitutes a cardinal aspect of logic. (EL §11A)

It is the nature of thought/being that we examine in the _Logic_, and its
development, like the development of any organism, exhibits a progression
through various necessary stages until it reaches its most determinate form.
However, unlike finite organisms, this progression has no ultimate disunity to
overcome.

There seems to be a non-accidental relation between Hegel&rsquo;s conception of the
absolute and finite things and Spinoza&rsquo;s characterization.

> E1p33s1: A thing is called necessary either by reason of its essence or by
> reason of its cause. For a thing’s existence follows necessarily either from
> its essence and definition or from a given efficient cause. And a thing is
> also called impossible from these same causes—namely, either because its
> essence, or definition, involves a contradiction, or because there is no
> external cause which has been determined to produce such a thing.

The _Logic_, in examining the nature of thought _as such_, is an explication of
what follows from the essence or nature of thought. In the case of finite
determinations of thought (i.e. finite things) however, there is always
something external from which they follow, or with respect to which they stand
as contraries and thus as moments to be sublated.[^fn:18]

Hence, it is only true of finite parts of this absolute that &ldquo;The
ripest maturity, the highest stage, that anything can attain is the one at
which its fall begins&rdquo; (SL 539/12:42).

[^fn:2]: (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Beiser 2005, 160</a>) goes so far as to characterize Hegel&rsquo;s method as an &ldquo;anti-method&rdquo;, i.e. &ldquo;a method to suspend all methods&rdquo;.

[^fn:6]: Forster notes that &ldquo;Hegel, over large stretches of his texts, deviates from the intended general structure of the method in more or less extreme ways.&rdquo; (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Forster 1993, 155</a>). But Forster also assumes that Hegel&rsquo;s method always takes the same determinate form; for criticism see (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_7">Houlgate 2006, 33–34</a>). It is also a matter of dispute as to whether Fichte himself construes the synthetic method as always taking a thesis-antithesis-synthesis form. See (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_18">Wood 2016, 63</a>) for discussion and defense of a broader conception of the synthetic method.

[^fn:8]: There is still a question as to why some self-contradictions (e.g. &ldquo;the red door is not red&rdquo;, &ldquo;married bachelor&rdquo;) don&rsquo;t admit of dialectical treatment.
[^fn:9]: Such a view of inference, where &rsquo;mediate inference&rsquo; is just the chain of moves from one clearly understood judgment to another, is held by Descartes and Locke, among others.
[^fn:10]: Accounts of Kant&rsquo;s conception of mediate inference that thereby appeal merely to the fact that such inference involves the connection of premises by a middle term, e.g. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_15">Rohlf 2010</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_17">Willaschek 2018</a>) are in this sense incomplete, since they do not indicate what exactly about the activity of _reason_, as opposed to understanding, it s that marks a special capacity for relating judgments.

[^fn:16]: This is an important feature of Hegel&rsquo;s characterization of understanding vs. reason in the _Encyclopedia_ discussion of §§79-82.
[^fn:17]: This isn&rsquo;t to say that dialectical activity must necessarily complete itself, or develop in a necessary way. Hegel is often taken to be committed to this. But the concept of epigenetic development I&rsquo;ve been appealing to here doesn&rsquo;t require it. Moreover, since Hegel considers the determinacy of the whole of logic is itself a partly historical process, it is clear that conditions may not always be such as to realize the proper development of thought. Again, we can see a clear analogy with an organism whose development in its proper manner may be arrested by various extraneous factors (e.g. not enough nutrients, or room to grow, etc.). Of course, the disanalogy here is that the absolute, as _absolute_, is conditioned by nothing and has nothing &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of it to limit it. So this leaves us with a question as to whether the analogy can be appropriately fleshed out.
