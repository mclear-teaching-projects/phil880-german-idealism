## <span class="section-num">1</span> The Dialectical &ldquo;Moment&rdquo; of Thinking {#the-dialectical-and-ldquo-moment-and-rdquo-of-thinking}

In the _Encyclopedia_ Hegel presents the &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo; in terms of a &ldquo;moment&rdquo; of
thinking, or rational activity more broadly.

> In terms of form, the logical domain has three sides: (&alpha;) the abstract side
> or that of the understanding, (&beta;) the dialectical or negatively rational
> side, (&gamma;) the speculative or positively rational side.

<!--quoteend-->

> (_Anmerking_): These three sides do not constitute three parts of logic, but are moments of every properly logical content [/Momente jedes Logisch-Reellen/], that is to say, of every concept or everything true in general. (EL §79/p. 125)

Here we see Hegel make a distinction between understanding, &ldquo;negative&rdquo; or
dialectical reason, and positive or &ldquo;speculative&rdquo; reason. These are not to be
understood as independent logical forms or faculties. They are rather three
aspects or characteristics of a single form of (rational) activity.[^fn:1]

For Hegel, the term &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; (_Verstand_) captures what Kant means by
&ldquo;understanding&rdquo; as well as what Kant typically means by the activity of
theoretical reason. Hegelian understanding grasps wholes in terms of their
parts, and seeks to connect parts together by means of necessary and
sufficient grounds. Moreover, each &ldquo;part&rdquo; is understood partly in terms of its
relation to what it _is not_. This is often captured in the phrase &ldquo;all
determination is negation&rdquo; (_Omnis determinatio est negatio_; HW p.9/15:11). For
example, in the determination of a figure (e.g. a square) one traces a line
that delimits a space (the square) from what it is not (the surrounding
space).

Hegel&rsquo;s position here is a very fair representation of how Kant thinks of
determination, or what amounts to the same, predication.

For Kant, determination involves exclusion, which excludes according to a law.

> Every **concept**, in regard to what is not contained in it, is indeterminate,
> and stands under the principle of **determinability**: that of **every two**
> contradictorily opposed predicates only one can apply to it, which rests on
> the principle of contradiction and hence is a merely logical principle/
> which abstracts from every content of cognition, and has in view nothing but
> the logical form of cognition.

<!--quoteend-->

> Every **thing**, however, as to its possibility, further stands under the
> principle of **thoroughgoing determination**; according to which, among **all
> possible** predicates of **things**, insofar as they are compared with their
> opposites, one must apply to it (A571-2/B599-600)

In the case of intellectual (i.e. logical) exclusion, the law is that of
contradiction. However, in the case of space and time, the law of
contradiction is not the basis of exclusion, but rather the topology of space
and time itself---what we can literally think of as its form. Since the law of
exclusion by which space and time determines each of its parts is
fundamentally different from the law of contradiction, we cannot construe
determination solely as a function of the intellect&rsquo;s activity, for the law of
contradiction is a basic law of the intellect&rsquo;s activity. Let me explain each
of these points.

Determination is exclusion in the sense of setting one of two opposing (i.e.
contrary) predicates as the predicate of a substance.[^fn:1] Here &ldquo;opposing&rdquo;
_can_ mean _logically_ opposing, as in, e.g., the predicates `<hot>` and `<not-hot>`.
But the opposition needn&rsquo;t take this form---i.e. it need not be determined by
the law of contradiction. Kant&rsquo;s clearest examples of this are what he comes
to call, starting in the 1760s but continuing through the critical period,
&ldquo;really opposing&rdquo; grounds, as contrasted with merely &ldquo;logically opposing&rdquo;
grounds.[^fn:2] For example in his _Negative Magnitudes_ he says,

> Real opposition is that where two predicates of a thing are opposed to
> each other, but not through the law of contradiction. Here, too, one
> cancels what is posited by the other, but the consequence is
> something. The motive force of a body in one direction and an equal
> tendency of the same body in the opposite direction do not contradict
> each other; as predicates, they are simultaneously possible in one
> body. The consequence of such an opposition is rest, which is
> something. It is, nonetheless, a true opposition. For that which is
> posited by the one tendency is cancelled by the other tendency, and
> the two tendencies are true predicates of one and the self-same thing,
> and they belong to it simultaneously. (2:171-2)

Forces can exclude one another through opposition, but the opposition
here is not that of _contradiction_. One piece of evidence Kant offers
for this is that opposing (i.e. contradictory) predicates cannot be
combined single being---e.g. a judgment (A150/B189-90)---while opposing
forces _can_ be combined in a single being. Kant&rsquo;s example in the latter
case is a stationary being that is so because of the outcome of being
acted on by an opposing force.[^fn:3]

So determination is the exclusion of one predicate in favor of its
opposite. What &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; means here depends on the kind of law to which
one appeals. In the case of _logical_ determination, the exclusion is
defined in terms of logically opposing predicates. In the case of _real_
determination, the exclusion is defined merely negatively, in terms of
predicates that oppose but not logically.

The critical period doctrine is thus one according to which a ground
determines by virtue of (i) the predicate/property; (ii) the law
governing the connection between positing that predicate and positing
its consequent. In the case of a logical ground the law is that of
contradiction, hence positing some predicate P has the consequence of
excluding or opposing ~P. To use a simple example, predicating
`<bachelor>` of John excludes John&rsquo;s being `<not-bachelor>`. Since
`<bachelor>` consists of &ldquo;marks&rdquo; (_Merken_) like (let&rsquo;s assume) `<male>`
and `<unmarried>`, predicating `<bachelor>` of John &ldquo;determines&rdquo; that he
is male and unmarried, to the exclusion of his being non-male or
married. Thus the logical ground `<bachelor>` is the basis of various
other analytic truths concerning John, such as that he is male and
unmarried.

So understanding consists in distinguishing and relating determinations, each
of which is understood in part through its negation of others. It is this
manner of seperating and opposing that then leads understanding (or so says
Hegel) to the negative or dialectical &ldquo;moment&rdquo; of reason, where a
determination becomes &ldquo;self-sublating&rdquo; or self-contradictory. What this
exactly comes to is highly obscure, and seems to depend in part on the
specific nature of the subject matter whole dialectical moments are being
traced. But given Hegel&rsquo;s characterization in the _Encyclopedia_ we can
tentatively draw some general features out, which seem applicable to all such
dialectical moments.

The first is that pertaining to the understanding itself. Suppose that one
judges of some object _o_ that that it is a particular way W (e.g. that the ball
is red) -- _o_ is thus _determined_ as being W. But what does being W about to? It
amounts to _o_&rsquo;s not being not-W. We&rsquo;ve now reached the cusp of the &ldquo;negative&rdquo;
or dialectical moment, because now it turns out that what was treated as a
single and independent thought---viz. of _o_&rsquo;s being W---turns out to require a
contrary thought---viz. of _o_&rsquo;s being not-W. This &ldquo;dialectical moment&rdquo; of
opposition between the thought of _o_ as W and as not-W does not however lead to
the annhilation of one&rsquo;s thought (recall that Kant thinks of contradictory
thought as self-annhilating). Instead it leads to a _positive_ turn in one&rsquo;s
thought, and this is the &ldquo;speculative&rdquo; moment of reason. In this positive
moment reason is conscious of some whole in virtue of which the parts are what
they are. So, for example, in the case of a judgment like &ldquo;the ball is red&rdquo;,
which then yields its opposing determination of not-red, we can contain these
two oppositions in a broader concept, <color>, as the positive outcome of this
otherwise negative activity.[^fn:4]

Thus understanding and speculative reason, while both features of rational
activity (i.e. &ldquo;thought&rdquo; in its broadest sense), are nevetheless opposed, in
the sense that the divisions and oppositions made or recognized By
understanding are resolved by seeing those divisions as themselves only
possible via appeal to some prior whole. It is this overall push and pull
between these features of thought (via the &ldquo;moment&rdquo; of dialectical activity)
that drives thinking, and is the source of all conceptual content (or
conceptual determination/determinacy, as Hegel sometimes says).


## <span class="section-num">2</span> The Objective Dialectic {#the-objective-dialectic}

Hegel does not, however, construe the dialectical moment as present only in
_thinking_, where that term is understood as something like a subjective or
psychological act.

> Properly construing and recognizing the dialectical dimension is of the
> highest importance. It is in general the principle of all movement, all
> life, and all actual activity. (EL 129, §81 A1)

<!--quoteend-->

> Everything that surrounds us can be viewed as an example of the dialectic.
> We know that all ﬁnite things, instead of being something ﬁxed and ultimate,
> are really changeable and perishable, and this is nothing but the dialectic
> of the ﬁnite. By virtue of this dialectic, the same thing (as in itself the
> other of itself) is driven beyond what it immediately is and turns over into
> its opposite. (EL 130, §81 A1)

These are not statements that are easily read as being about our concepts, or
the nature of thought more broadly, rather than about the world itself.
Hegel&rsquo;s position thus seems to be that the dialectical moment is not simply a
feature of our thinking but is present in reality itself, apart from how we
think of it. This is, of course, in keeping with his conception of the
subject-object distinction (and thus the thought-reality distinction) as
non-fundamental and derivative of a more basic unity (or even identity).

This raises a general question (or set of questions) for how we understand
Hegel&rsquo;s system as a whole. Is it supposed to be the case that every
distinction in being has a counterpart in thinking and vice versa. How
seriously should we take the Spinozistic doctrine (assuming Hegel accepts it)
that &ldquo;the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and
connection of things&rdquo; (EIIP7)? Book three of the _Logic_ is the &ldquo;subjective&rdquo;
logic, in which we see a discussion of concept, judgment, and syllogism.
Should we expect to see a sense in which nature coneptualizes, judges, and
&ldquo;syllogizes&rdquo;, apart from the specific acts of (at least potentially)
self-conscious beings like us?
