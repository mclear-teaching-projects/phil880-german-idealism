In these notes I discuss Schelling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Identity&rdquo; philosophy, or &ldquo;absolute idealism&rdquo;. I
also discuss his related doctrine concerning intellectual intuition and construction,
as well as the prospects and problems raised by his conception of reality in terms of
the &ldquo;absolute&rdquo;.[^fn:1]

## <span class="section-num">1</span> What is Absolute Idealism? -- An Overview {#what-is-absolute-idealism-an-overview}

At the beginning of his _Presentation_ essay Schelling says that &ldquo;what idealism or
realism might be, or some possible third position compounded from the two, is by no
means clear or obvious, but something still to be decided&rdquo; (4:109). This might make
it somewhat difficult to say how (or whether) his view in the essay is &ldquo;idealist&rdquo; in
nature. But Schelling helpfully goes on to contrast his view with Fichte by saying:

> Fichte, e.g., might have conceived idealism in a completely subjective sense while
> I, on the other hand, conceived it in an objective one. Fichte might have held an
> idealism relative to the standpoint of reflection, whereas I situated myself and
> the principle of idealism at the standpoint of production. To put this contrast in
> the most intelligible terms, if idealism in the subjective sense said that the I is
> everything, idealism in the objective sense would be forced to say the reverse:
> everything is = I. There is no doubt these views are different, although no one
> will deny that both are idealistic. (4:109)

The distinction Schelling makes here is most clear in terms of a difference in what
is subject and what is predicate in an identity statement. In Fichte&rsquo;s &ldquo;subjective&rdquo;
meaning the I or ego is the subject and the universe is its predicate; in Schelling&rsquo;s
&ldquo;objective&rdquo; meaning this is reversed. This matters because, in eighteenth-century
logic, the subject stands as the _reason_ or _ground_ for its predicate. Hence Schelling
construes the ego as grounded in the totality of nature rather than, as Fichte argued
nature being grounded in the subject or ego.[^fn:2]

This helps us understand the difference between Fichte&rsquo;s purported &ldquo;subjective&rdquo;
idealism and Schelling&rsquo;s &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; or &ldquo;objective&rdquo; idealism. Each is disputing the
metaphysical status of reason (in the broadest sense) vis-a-vis nature. Fichte
construes nature as the product of reason&rsquo;s activity---nature is constituted by the
intellectual acts of pure I or ego. Schelling in contrast construes the ego as the
highest expression or &ldquo;potency&rdquo; of nature. Reason is &ldquo;in&rdquo; nature itself, and the
self-conscious subject is its highest or most complex expression.

However, absolute idealism should not be seen as a form of dogmatism. It does not
seek to reduce or eliminate the rational or conscious from its conception of nature.
It also, and perhaps just as importantly, does not see nature as _metaphysically prior_
to or _independent_ of reason/self-consciousness. Instead, the self-conscious rational
subject and the order of nature are both seen as manifestations of single underlying
subject---the absolute, otherwise expressed in terms of the &ldquo;indifference point&rdquo; of
subject-object identity. The absolute is the _tertium quid_ from which rational
subjectivity and the order of nature are derived.


## <span class="section-num">2</span> Understanding Schelling&rsquo;s Oppositions {#understanding-schelling-and-rsquo-s-oppositions}

Schelling often contrasts three sets of concepts:

1.  The subjective vs the objective
2.  The mental vs the physical
3.  The ideal vs the real

How should we understand each of these three oppositions? Schelling often aligns the
mental, subjective, and ideal on one side and the physical, the objective, and the
real on the other. But the terms of each class are not really synonyms for one
another.

The first distinction, between subjective and objective, is an _intentional_
distinction concerning the structure of conscious experience. The second distinction,
between the mental and physical, is an _ontological_ distinction between kinds of
object that are part of experience. And the third distinction, between the ideal and
real, is a _formal_ (for lack of a better word) distinction between archetype and
ectype.


## <span class="section-num">3</span> Knowledge of the Absolute (Construction) {#knowledge-of-the-absolute--construction}

For both Schelling and Hegel, knowledge of the absolute relies on our capacity for
&ldquo;intellectual intuition&rdquo;, though in a sense largely different from that of Fichte,
and only partially grounded in Kant. I first explicate some of the Kantian background
before turning to the positive conception in detail.


### <span class="section-num">3.1</span> The Kantian Background -- Seeing the Universal in the Particular {#the-kantian-background-seeing-the-universal-in-the-particular}

Kant, in his _Critique of the Power of Judgment_, distinguishes between the intuitive
intellect of God and the discursive intellect of finite rational beings. There are,
for our purposes, two salient features of such intuition. First, it is _amodal_, in the
sense that intellectual intuition is of a reality that exists, and for which alethic
modal distinctions regarding the possible, contingent, or necessary do not hold.[^fn:3]

> It is absolutely necessary for the human understanding to distinguish between the
> possibility and the actuality of things. The reason for this lies in the subject
> and the nature of its cognitive faculties. For if two entirely heterogeneous
> elements were not required for the exercise of these faculties, understanding for
> concepts and sensible intuition for objects corresponding to them, then there would
> be no such distinction (between the possible and the actual). That is, if our
> understanding were intuitive, it would have no objects except what is actual.
> Concepts (which pertain merely to the possibility of an object) and sensible
> intuitions (which merely give us something, without thereby allowing us to cognize
> it as an object) would both disappear. Now, however, all of our distinction between
> the merely possible and the actual rests on the fact that the former signiﬁes only
> the position of the representation of a thing with respect to our concept and, in
> general, our faculty for thinking, while the latter signiﬁes the positing of the
> thing in itself (apart from this concept). Thus the distinction of possible from
> actual things is one that is merely subjectively valid for the human understanding,
> since we can always have something in our thoughts although it does not exist, or
> represent something as given even though we do not have any concept of it. ... I
> cannot presuppose that in every such being thinking and intuiting, hence the
> possibility and actuality of things, are two different conditions for the exercise
> of its cognitive faculties. For an understanding to which this distinction did not
> apply, all objects that I cognize would **be** (exist), and the possibility of some
> that did not exist, i.e., their contingency if they did exist, as well as the
> necessity that is to be distinguished from that, would not enter into the
> representation of such a being at all. (5:401-3)

Thus the intuitive intellect cognizes only what exists---and there is nothing further
_to_ cognize, as there are no possibilities or necessities.

A second important feature of intellectual intuition is that its content is
comprehended in a different manner from that of discursive cognition

> it may be conceded that we would ﬁnd no distinction between a natural mechanism and
> a technique of nature, i.e., a connection to ends in it, if our understanding were
> not of the sort that must go from the universal to the particular, and the power of
> judgment can thus cognize no purposiveness in the particular, and hence make no
> determining judgments, without having a universal law under which it can subsume
> the particular. But now since the particular, as such, contains something
> contingent with regard to the universal, but reason nevertheless still requires
> unity, hence lawfulness, in the connection of particular laws of nature (which
> lawfulness of the contingent is called purposiveness), and the a priori derivation
> of the particular laws from the universal, as far as what is contingent in the
> former is concerned, is impossible through the determination of the concept of the
> object, thus the concept of the purposiveness of nature in its products is a
> concept that is necessary for the human power of judgment in regard to nature but
> does not pertain to the determination of the objects themselves, thus a subjective
> principle of reason for the power of judgment which, as regulative (not
> constitutive), is just as necessarily valid for our **human power of judgment** as if
> it were an objective principle. (5:404)

God&rsquo;s intellect moves from the universal to the particular. Since this intellection
is intuitive, one might say that God intuits the universal in or through the
particular. In contrast, our discursive intellect must reflect on particulars given
in intuition until we generate a concept under which we can subsume the particular in
an act of reflecting judgment.


### <span class="section-num">3.2</span> Schelling&rsquo;s Conception of Intellectual Intuition {#schelling-and-rsquo-s-conception-of-intellectual-intuition}

Schelling characterizes cognition of the absolute as being via intellectual
intuition. I first explain central features of such intuition and then talk about its
role in what Schelling calls &ldquo;construction.&rdquo;


#### <span class="section-num">3.2.1</span> Features of Intellectual Intuition {#features-of-intellectual-intuition}

Intellectual intuition is a function of _reason_ (FD 4:369), which allows the intuiting
subject to &ldquo;see&rdquo;, or intuit, the universal in the particular in a way that transcends
any judgment.

> it [intellectual intuition] is simply the capacity to see the universal in the
> particular, the infinite in the finite, the two combined into a living unity. The
> anatomist who dissects a plant or an animal body surely believes he immediately
> sees the plant or the animal organism, but strictly speaking he sees only the
> individual thing he designates plant or body. To see the plant in the plant, the
> organ in the organism, in a word to see the concept or indifference within
> difference is possible only through intellectual intuition. (FD 4:362)

Intellectual intuition also is such as to be identical with what it intuits.

> We call this cognition intellectual intuition. Intuition, because all intuition is
> an identification of thought and being {4:369} and because only in intuition as
> such is reality. ... [Cognition of the absolute is] found only in an intuition that
> absolutely identifies thought and being, which because it formally expresses the
> absolute also becomes the expression of its essence. We call this intuition
> intellectual because it is reason-intuition, and because, as cognition, it is
> absolutely one with the object of knowing. (FD 4:369)

There are five central features of intellectual intuition for Schelling. It is:

1.  An activity of reason
2.  An immediate relation to a being
3.  Non-discursive
4.  Act-object identity
5.  A conscious relating to both universal and particular in one

Note that this conception of reason is different from Kant&rsquo;s. Reason is no longer a
faculty for concepts or inference---that is relegated to the understanding. Reason
now intuits the universal in the particular. Thus, as Schelling embraces the
possibility of intellectual intuition in human beings, he also reconceives the
faculties of rational human beings whereby such intuition is possible.


#### <span class="section-num">3.2.2</span> The Method of Construction {#the-method-of-construction}

What is the method of construction? Unfortunately, this is left rather unclear by
Schelling. On the one hand, he makes a relatively clear critical argument against
Kant that philosophy is like mathematics in that it constructs the objects of
knowledge. But the notion of &ldquo;construction&rdquo; here is not entirely clear. Schelling
obviously wants to compare it to Kant&rsquo;s conception of intuiting the universal in the
particular, in a sense similar to that discussed by Kant in the passages from the
third _Critique_ quoted above.

> construction as such is in mathematics and philosophy always the absolute and _real_
> equalization [_Gleichsetzung_] of universal and particular. The particular in
> geometry is not the empirical triangle sketched upon a piece of paper, but,
> according to Kant himself, _the triangle of pure intuition_. Construction has only
> this triangle of pure intuition in view; the empirical is related accidentally, as
> an _accidens_, upon which construction does not reflect. _This_ particular is however
> already the particular _presented in the universal_ and insofar as it is an idea, or
> the real universal itself, it has an _essential_ unity and not merely a formal
> unity. (CP 276)

Insofar as construction allows this, and construction is used in philosophy, then
&ldquo;philosophy can be seen as a presentation of the particular in the universal&rdquo; (CP
275). Unfortunately for Schelling, the conception of construction in mathematics to
which he appeals is itself rather obscure. This obscurity is compounded when we move
to the extraordinarily abstract level of philosophical construction. This difficulty
is further exacerbated by Schelling&rsquo;s insistence that the intellectual intuition
required for construction is not itself possible for everyone. He says,

> Perhaps one might ask of it the question that Plato asked of virtue: can it be
> learned or not, can it be attained through practice, or is it perhaps to be acquired
> neither through instruction nor through industry, but is inborn in us by nature, or
> is it lent to humans by a heavenly gift? Clearly it is nothing that can be learned.
> All attempts to teach it, therefore, are entirely useless in rigorously scientific
> philosophy. (FD 4:361)

Only those gifted with genius will be capable of doing so. Schelling here rejects the
concerns of other philosophers (here Fiche is obviously the primary target)
concerning the seeming inability of non-philosophers---or &ldquo;ordinary
consciousness&rdquo;---to do philosophy. In fact, Schelling actively opposed efforts to
provide some means of access of the ordinary person to philosophy and recommended,
instead, “cutting off sharply any access to philosophy and isolating it on every ﬂank
from ordinary knowledge, so that there is no road or path leading from it to
philosophy” (FD 4:362). This elitism and disdain for some egress from ordinary to
philosophical consciousness will serve as a central plank in Hegel&rsquo;s criticism of
Schelling&rsquo;s position.


## <span class="section-num">4</span> Subject & Object {#subject-and-object}

One of the characteristic features of German Idealism, especially as it develops
after Kant, is a conception of &ldquo;subject-object&rdquo; identity. What is this and why is it
important?


### <span class="section-num">4.1</span> Kant on Subject & Object {#kant-on-subject-and-object}

Kant says in the preface to the second edition of the _Critique of Pure Reason_ that
&ldquo;we can cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have put into them&rdquo;
(Bxviii). In the _Critique_ he goes on to argue that the &ldquo;order and regularity in
[appearances] that we call nature” is an order put there by the “nature of our mind”
(A125; see also B165).

Kant argues for this position by giving us a characterization of the concept `<object>`
in a way such that the concept indicates only what is &ldquo;internal&rdquo; to the mind.

> Understanding is, generally speaking, the faculty of cognitions. These consist in the
> determinate relation of given representations to an object. An object, however, is
> that in the concept of which the manifold of a given intuition is united. (B137)

Similarly, in his discussion of causation he says,

> If we investigate what new characteristic is given to our representations by the
> **relation to an object**, and what is the dignity that they thereby receive, we find
> that it does nothing beyond making the combination of representations necessary in
> a certain way, and subjecting them to a rule; and conversely that objective
> significance is conferred on our representations only insofar as a certain order in
> their temporal relation is necessary. (A197/B242-3)

Kant here indicates that what we think of as an &ldquo;object&rdquo; is really just a set of
relations between our representations---viz., their necessary combination. The origin
of such necessary combination is not itself anything independent of the mind, but
rather the mind&rsquo;s &ldquo;synthesizing&rdquo; activity in applying the fundamental and a priori
concepts of an object, which Kant calls the categories. This has (at least) two
significant upshots.

First, what it is to _be_ an object of the senses is to be a &ldquo;causally unitary,
spatiotemporally persisting substance whose present complex of interrelated
properties are a function of its causal nature and its causal history, which is in
thoroughgoing law-governed community with other objects, and which is made of stuff
that cannot come into or go out of existence absolutely.&rdquo;[^fn:4] That is, an object of
the senses is what it is in virtue of falling under the &ldquo;schematized&rdquo; categories
(i.e. the categories in their application to a being in time). As Kant puts the point
in the second section of the System of the Principles of Pure Understanding, &ldquo;The
conditions of the **possibility of experience** in general are at the same time
conditions of the **possibility of the objects of experience**&rdquo; (A158/B197). Second, and
more generally, an _object_, whether of the senses or not, must be something that falls
under the categories, even in their &ldquo;unschematized&rdquo; (i.e. non-temporal) forms. For
example, consider the category `<substance-inherence>`.[^fn:5] Nothing can _be_ an object
unless it is the kind of being that both substands and subsists, which is to say that
it is both that in which properties inhere, and which exists independently of (in the
sense of not inhereing in) other things. In this sense `<substance-inherence>` is not
only maximally general, but also metaphysically fundamental. Anything that is or
could be is either a subject of inherence or inheres in some subject. Hence, in
applying the category of substance one is employing not only a maximally general way
of _thinking about_ a being, but also designating a maximally fundamental fact _about
being_ (i.e. what it is to be) itself. A similar point holds for all of the other
categories.[^fn:6] The categories are thus _both_ the discursively fundamental ways of
representing objects, and the ways of representing what is fundamental _about_ objects.

It is for this reason that Kant considers &ldquo;nature&rdquo; as the orderly realm of objects of
experience, to be what it is (though not _that_ it is) in virtue of the fundamental
forms of activity of our minds.

> Categories are concepts that prescribe laws _a priori_ to appearances, thus to nature
> as the sum total of all appearances (_natura materialiter spectata_) ... all
> appearances of nature, as far as their combination is concerned, stand under the
> categories, on which nature (considered merely as nature in general) depends, as
> the original ground of its necessary lawfulness (as _natura formaliter spectata_)
> (B163–5)

We can thus have a priori cognition of the lawful structure or order of nature
precisely because that structure or order is _identical_ with the most basic forms of
the intellect&rsquo;s activity. Thus, though Kant doesn&rsquo;t put things this way, the
possibility of scientific knowledge of nature is explained by a kind of identity
between the form of our own mental activity and the form of objects in nature.


### <span class="section-num">4.2</span> Subject-Object Identity in Fichte {#subject-object-identity-in-fichte}

Fichte&rsquo;s position (in the Jena period) is largely consistent with Kant&rsquo;s, though it
also goes beyond it, or at least goes beyond Kant&rsquo;s explicit discussion. Fichte
contends that the fundamental principle &rsquo;A = A&rsquo; is the first principle of philosophy.
This is turn is founded on (both with respect to certainty in its form, and to its
content) on the &rsquo;I = I&rsquo;.

The ego is a special kind of object in that it is identical with the subject that is
aware if it. It is, in this sense, a &ldquo;subject-object&rdquo;. Thus, in the sort of
&ldquo;transcendental&rdquo; self-consciousness through intellectual intuition, knower and known
are identical. This identity between knower and known is the original basis for all
other knowledge. Out of this point Fichte develops a theory concerning the sense in
which such a subject comes to be conscious of an objective world, where &ldquo;objective&rdquo;
has a similar meaning as it does in Kant. That is, it indicates the way in which the
subject posits that which it can know as an object. Unlike Kant, however, Fichte also
rejects the notion of a genuinely external existence that provides the matter for our
subjective forms of activity to structure. In this sense Fichte articulates a more
thoroughgoing idealism.[^fn:7]

Fichte&rsquo;s system thus starts from a _complete_ identity of subject and object, as
(self-)posited in intellectual intuition. This complete identity is thus the basis
for answering the epistemological question as to what explains the possibility of
knowledge, if knowledge requires (partial) identity of the knower (subject) with what
is known (object). Fichte also presents an argument (and a method -- the synthetic
method) for how, out of this unity, all concepts of difference are derived or
generated. There is a further question as to whether this original unity has an
ontological significance but I leave that to the side for now.

Fichte contends that the absolute subject, in positing itself, is also opposed to
itself (as the &ldquo;not-self&rdquo; or &ldquo;object&rdquo; pole of its own self-consciousness). This might
seem to lead to a contradiction and, in that sense, a dissolution or nihilism of
rational activity.

But Fichte contends that that the contradiction or opposition between the self and
not-self can be resolved. It is resolved by positing a third concept—the concept of
divisibility—which unites the two sides (GWL 1:110–11). The synthetic method of
reasoning by which the novel concept is produced involves “discovering in opposites
the respect in which they are alike” (GWL 1:112–13). So, from an original identity,
opposition is derived, which is then resolved in the positing of a new concept in
which a new (partial) identity is discovered. According to Fichte, this resolution of
contradiction through the synthesis of opposites in a new concept is necessary for
all scientific knowledge. As he says of the move from the contradiction between self
and not-self to the synthetic concept of divisibility,

> there can be no further question as to the possibility of this [synthesis], nor can
> any ground for it be given; it is absolutely possible, and we are entitled to it
> without further grounds of any kind. (GWL 1:114)

This synthetic method is importantly different from the analytical method (of
analyzing given concepts into their components), which also leads to oppositions or
contradictions. Fichte claims that with the analytic method “we not only do not get
very far, as Kant says; we do not get anywhere at all” (GWL 1:113). The analytic
method does not generate new concepts, or new ideneity relations, but merely
generates concepts that are already present in the content of the concept(s) being
analyzed. This means that in the case of a contradiction generated through mere
conceptual analysis, there is no positive result. In contrast, the synthetic method
enables us to move beyond contradiction and thus avoid being left with nothing (at
least from the perspective of reason).


### <span class="section-num">4.3</span> Absolute Identity in Schelling {#absolute-identity-in-schelling}

Schelling&rsquo;s conception of subject-object identity owes several central elements to
Kant and Fichte, but it is also deeply influenced by Plato and Spinoza. From Kant and
Fichte it takes the idea that knowledge requires a kind of identity between knower
and known. From Spinoza Schelling takes (among other things) the idea that it is not
individual subjects that are knowers, but rather the totality or unity of all that is
-- i.e. the &ldquo;one&rdquo; being or the &ldquo;absolute&rdquo;. From Plato, Schelling takes the idea that
the ultimate object of knowledge is not a finite particular (or &ldquo;appearance&rdquo;) but
archetype of any such existence. Let&rsquo;s take these in turn.

We&rsquo;ve seen already that Kant and Fichte construe the possibility of knowledge of a
genuinely &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; kind as depending on a kind of identity between knower and
known. We know of objects only what &ldquo;we ourselves have put into them.&rdquo; However,
Schelling sees this starting point as objectionably _subjective_.[^fn:8]

Schelling construes Fichte&rsquo;s system as unable to fully account for the objectivity of
nature, making it instead something that is simply an extension of the conscious
subject. But he also regards Fichte as correct in objecting to &ldquo;dogmatic&rdquo; attempts to
reduce subjectivity to something purely objective. This leads to Schelling&rsquo;s
articulation of an _indifference point_ in which there is kind of pure homogeneity that
is both epistemically and metaphysically prior to the distinction between subject and
object.

> we admit no opposition between subject and object (since what is posited in the one
> position and in the other is the very same identity; subject and object are thus in
> essence one), but perchance just some sort of difference between subjectivity and
> objectivity. (DS 4:124)

The &rsquo;absolute&rsquo; _is_, in a sense identity itself. As Schelling puts it, &ldquo;absolute
identity _is_ only as the identity of an identity, and this is the form of its being,
inseparable from its being itself&rdquo; (DS 4:121). Schelling also identifies the
absolute, or indifference point, with reason (DS 4:114) and claims that

> The ultimate law for the being of reason, and, since there is nothing outside
> reason (§ 2), for all being (because it is comprehended within reason) is the law
> of identity, which with respect to all being is expressed by A = A. (DS 4:116)

So identity is the ultimate law of reason, and through reason, of all being. In
cognizing the absolute we cognize this identity. Schelling is quick to point out that
this notion of &ldquo;reason&rdquo; is not that of any particular finite subject&rsquo;s psychology or
faculty.

> Reason’s thought is foreign to everyone; to conceive it as absolute, and thus to
> come to the standpoint I require, one must abstract from what does the thinking.
> (DS 4:114)

This brings us to the question of _who_ it is that is doing the cognizing. Schelling,
seemingly inspired by Spinoza, claims that _every_ (finite) being is itself a cognizing
of this identity (DW 4:122). The idea here seems to be related to Spinoza&rsquo;s view that
every mental mode is the representation (or perhaps form) of some material
mode.[^fn:9] But such beings are only &rsquo;appearances&rsquo;. The only _an Sich_ or &ldquo;in itself&rdquo;
is the totality that Schelling identifies with the entire universe (DS 4:125). So
there aren&rsquo;t really paricular thinkers of the absolute -- instead all finite beings
are, in so far as they are, parts of a totality, which alone exits.

> To the one who has not withdrawn from the absolute center of gravity, it is the
> first being, the being that never was produced but is if anything at all is; it is
> to such a degree that the individual being too is possible only inside it, while
> outside it, apart from things separated in mere thought, there is truly nothing.
> (DS 4:128)

This point raises an important question, of which Schelling is quite aware, which is
&ldquo;how is it possible for anything to separate itself from this absolute totality or be
separated from it in thought?&rdquo; (DS 4:128). Schelling&rsquo;s position here is quite
disappointing. He contends that it is &ldquo;a question that cannot be answered here&rdquo; since
&ldquo;such a separation is intrinsically impossible&rdquo;. Schelling sees the fixation of
belief concerning finite existence to be a defect of understanding of one&rsquo;s relation
to the absolute. But this position, absent some further argument, can seem like so
much dogmatic insistence rather than genuine truth. Even worse, articulate knowledge
for finite rational beings such as ourselves is always ultimately _predicative_ in
structure, but such structure requires _difference_, which is not part of the absolute.

Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy of identity seems to ensure the possibility of knowledge of
ultimate reality but at the cost of making that knowledge something that transcends
any finite subject and is itself ineffable. The absolute thus threatens to become an
&ldquo;empty night&rdquo; that is the &ldquo;end of...philosophy&rdquo; (DS 4:403).[^fn:10]

[^fn:5]: Kant is reported to have said that `<substance>` is the &ldquo;most preeminent&rdquo; of the categories and &ldquo;thus the basis of all other cognition&rdquo; (_Metaphysik Mrongovius_, 29:769--70).
[^fn:6]: The modal categories are the exception since, as Kant indicates, they are &ldquo;merely subjectively valid for the human understanding&rdquo; and &ldquo;are not valid of objects in general&rdquo; (CPJ 5:402); see also [@stang2016, ch. 10; @kohl2015c].
[^fn:7]: See (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_23">Wood 2016</a>) for a much less metaphysical reading of Fichte&rsquo;s position.
[^fn:8]: There&rsquo;s a real question as to whether this charge of subjectivism is fair. For some defense of Fichte see (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_18">Pippin 2000</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Beiser 2002</a>).

See also Hegel&rsquo;s derisive claim that Schelling&rsquo;s absolute is &ldquo;the night in which, as one says, all cows are black&rdquo; (PdG 2:18).
