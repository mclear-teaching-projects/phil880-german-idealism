## <span class="section-num">1</span> Overview of the Categories of Determinateness (Quality) {#overview-of-the-categories-of-determinateness--quality}

The categories of determinateness (_Bestimmtheit_) or quality (_Qualität_) are
three -- `<being>`, `<existence>`, and `<being-for-itself>`. This contrasts with
Kant&rsquo;s characterization of quality as consisting of `<reality>`, `<negation>`, and
`<limitation>`. It&rsquo;s interesting that Hegel begins with quality, as Kant (in the
Principles) begins with discussion of quantity.[^fn:1] The categories of
quality are:

-   Being
    -   Nothing
    -   Becoming
-   Determinate being/existence (_Dasein_)
    -   Finitude
    -   Infinity
-   Being-for-itself
    -   One-many
    -   Repulsion-attraction

Within each of these are various further determinations, such as `<quality>`,
`<reality>`, `<negation>`, `<something>`, `<limit>`, etc.

Why this structure rather than some other? Hegel&rsquo;s answer must be that this
structure (or path) is necessary, and it is necessary because it follows
from the nature of thought/being itself. In general, we can see the
&ldquo;movement&rdquo; of the development of the categories in thought as from sheer
unmediated indeterminacy to the determinate specification of _a_ being. Thus
the progression is from the nature of being to its basic determinate form as
_something_ that _is_.

There are many questions one might ask with regard to the opening of the _Logic_
(at least with regard to its main content). But the first must be _why this_?
Why start with quality? In the _Encyclopedia_ he remarks that

> _Quality_ is, to begin with, the determinacy that is identical with being in
> the sense that something ceases to be what it is when it loses its quality.
> By contrast, _quantity_ is the determinacy that is external to being and
> indifferent in relation to it. Thus, for instance, a house remains what it
> is, whether it is bigger or smaller, and red remains red, be it brighter or
> darker. (EL §85 Z)

This helps clarify why we start with the categories of quality -- they concern
being as such, rather than an external relation _to_ it (quantity).

### <span class="section-num">2.1</span> Starting Points {#starting-points}

Why start with `<being>`?

> the beginning ought not itself to be already a first _and_ an other, for
> anything which is in itself a first _and_ an other implies that an advance
> has already been made. Consequently, that which constitutes the
> beginning, the beginning itself, is to be taken as something
> unanalyzable, taken in its simple, unfilled immediacy; and therefore _as
> being_, as complete emptiness. (SL 52/21:62)

Hegel&rsquo;s claim is that we must begin with that which is wholly immediate, and
hence not mediated by anything else. In this sense then it seems the reasons
to start with quality are the same as those for starting with `<being>=`, though
there is a sense in which Hegel could also have started from <nothing>==, since
it is equally immediate. This also raises an important question -- are we to
read the opening of the _Logic_ as answering the question as to why there is
something rather than nothing? For example, Houlgate takes Hegel to provide a
straightforward answer to this:

> Hegel’s answer is simple: there has to be something because logically
> nothing slides into being, being transforms itself into determinacy, and
> being’s irreducible determinacy in turn proves to be something.[^fn:2]

However, this strikes me as somewhat misleading. Hegel does not _start_ with
`<nothing>`, rather he starts with `<being>` and shows that _that_ &ldquo;slides into&rdquo;
(or vanishes into) `<nothing>` and vice versa. So there seems rather to be a
kind of priority to <being>, even if it is identical (in some sense) with
`<nothing>`.

Another option is to read Hegel as starting with a fact, or perhaps more
in line with Fichte, with a &ldquo;fact-act&rdquo; (_Tathandlung_)---viz. the act of
thinking. In this sense the _Logic_ opens with the claim that thinking
_is_.[^fn:3] This differs from Fichte&rsquo;s starting point in that nothing is
assumed here as to _what_ it is that is thinking, or even that thinking
entails a thinker. Moreover, instead of presupposing that thought is
&ldquo;absolutely spontaneous&rdquo; or that it is governed by specific (i.e.
&ldquo;logical&rdquo;) laws, Hegel instead contends that thought &ldquo;moves&rdquo; and that it
moves in the sense of &ldquo;immediately vanishing into its opposite&rdquo; (SL
60/21:69). It may turn out that the _way_ that thought moves admits of
lawful characterization, but this is not presupposed at the outset.


### <span class="section-num">2.2</span> Thinking or Intuiting? {#thinking-or-intuiting}

Another curious feature of the opening of the _Logic_ is that Hegel
seemingly treats thinking and intuiting as interchangeable. For example,
in discussing being Hegel says,

> [t]here is _nothing_ to be intuited in [being], if one can speak here of
> intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little
> is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking

and similarly in the discussion of nothing he says,

> [i]n so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it makes a
> difference whether something or _nothing_ is being intuited or thought. To
> intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are
> distinguished and so nothing _is_ (concretely exists) in our intuiting or
> thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure
> being (SL 59/21:69)

From a Kantian standpoint this is surprising since intuiting is inherently
relational -- there must be something actual to which the intuition is
related. This is part of why Fichte characterizes the immediate consciousness
one has of one&rsquo;s activity in thinking as an intellectual _intuition_. It is a
relation to something actual (viz. in Fichte&rsquo;s terms, a self-relating to the
actuality of the activity). In contrast, conceptual thought is typically taken
to be _existence-independent_. That is to say, one can think of that which does
not exists---conceptualization and judgment does not entail existence.

Hence, insofar as Hegel begins with an intuiting that is not an intuiting of a
particular, but rather of sheer indeterminate being/nothing, and also in
construing this as a kind of thinking that is inseperable from its object, he
is tacitly employing a conception of mental activity that is largely identical
with features of intellectual intuition, as employed by Kant, Fichte, and
Schelling (though not identical with all the varied aspects of how each of
these three uses the notion).


### <span class="section-num">2.3</span> The Identity of Being and Nothing {#the-identity-of-being-and-nothing}

The conclusions of Hegel&rsquo;s initial two paragraphs are startling. They are:

> 1.  Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact _nothing_, and neither more
>     nor less than nothing.
> 2.  Nothing is therefore the same determination or rather absence of
>     determination, and thus altogether the same as what pure _being_ is (SL
>     59/21:69).

Note that Hegel cannot _argue_ for either (1) or (2), at least not at the
beginning. To do so would be to presuppose something about argument,
thinking, and thus about concepts, judgment, truth, and reasoning. So in
whatever way we arrive at (1) and (2), it is not via a deductive (or
inductive, etc.) argument. So how do we get to these claims?

If we take seriously Hegel&rsquo;s introductory remarks about the movement of
thinking, then we should read the beginning of his discussion here in just
that way, which means that the thinking that _is_, but is so purely
indeterminately, of its own accord (or we might say, of its own nature),
adverts to nothing, and vice versa. Is this a phenomenological claim, in the
sense of the _Phenomenology_? Not obviously, since it is not about the
_appearance_ of what thinking is, etc., but about the _truth_ of this. More
generally, the topic of the _Phenomenology_ is experience (in the broadly
Reinholdian sense of that term), but the topic of the _Logic_ is _thought_ (in a
sense that is not fully obvious at the start of the _Logic_). And it doesn&rsquo;t
seem right to say that the account Hegel gives here is &ldquo;phenomenological&rdquo; in
something more like our contemporary sense, since it isn&rsquo;t one concerned
simply with &ldquo;what it is like&rdquo; to be thinking in a particular way, where &ldquo;what
it is like&rdquo; denotes some individual psychological state (or property thereof)
that can be typed by what it is like to have it/be in it.

Perhaps there is a middle way here. Insofar as the reader of the _Logic_ is
also a thinker, the activity of working through Hegel&rsquo;s discussion is
similarly the activity of one&rsquo;s own thinking as proceeding in a similar
manner. Here again we see another point of possible connection with
Fichte&rsquo;s method. The reader, instead of being invited (or summoned) to
think of themself, simply _thinks_, and in doing so sees particular results.
The first invitation is that of thinking of pure being, which ultimately
comes to nothing. The second invitation is to then think of this nothing.
But the nothing that one thinks thus _is_, and one is thereby thinking of
being again. We then have a kind of oscillation in thought between these
two contents. These are identical in the sense that they both are thoughts
of pure indeterminacy. But they are different in the sense that they are
held as opposites to one another by the understanding (i.e. that &rsquo;moment&rsquo;
or &rsquo;aspect&rsquo; of thinking that considers features in complete isolation for
one another). As Houlgate puts it, &ldquo;All we may do is consider the concept
of indeterminate being and note what, if anything, that concept _itself_
turns out to be or do&rdquo;.[^fn:4] Putting things this way also helps us keep
in mind the sense in which the method of the _Logic_ is identical with its
subject matter. Thus the dynamic of change or transition is not external
to the various categorial forms in the _Logic_ (see Hegel&rsquo;s comments in
Remark 3), but rather identical with it---it is the dynamic of those forms
themselves.

Now, that said, what should we make of the opening two claims? It seems as if
what Hegel is contending is that there is something _erroneous_ or incorrect
about our thought of being and of nothing (or the concepts thereof). That is,
in thinking of being we turn out to be thinking of nothing and vice versa. If
we took this thought of being, which ultimately turns to nothing, as a kind of
independent content then we would be making a mistake. Similarly for the
thought of nothing. It turns out that in treating `<being>` and `<nothing>` as
distinct and independent concepts we are faced with a contradiction, the
resolution of which requires situating these concepts with respect to some
more determinate concept in which they are no longer opposed.

Hegel sums up this (surprising?) claim of identity and difference by saying that

> 1.  [i] _Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same_. The truth is
>     neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into
>     nothing and nothing into being – “has passed over,” not passes over. [ii]
>     But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it
>     is rather that _they are not the same_, that they are absolutely distinct
>     yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that _each_ immediately
>     _vanishes in its opposite_. Their truth is therefore this movement of the
>     immediate vanishing of the one into the other: _becoming_, a movement
>     in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just
>     as immediately dissolved itself (SL 59-60/21:69-70).

According to Hegel, to think `<being>` or `<nothing>` is not to think some
determinate independent content, nor is it a kind of independent _being_ (or
nonbeing). To think so is to think merely as our &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; would have
things. Instead there is a more determinate content---`<becoming>`---that is the
thought of coming to be and passing away.

[^fn:3]: We might even just want to say that the _Logic_ begins with <is> itself---or what is the same---with the activity of thought, which is an activity of connection captured in the copula. So in this sense we are both identifying thought with being and capturing the basic feature of thought as such---i.e. as a connection that signifies being.
