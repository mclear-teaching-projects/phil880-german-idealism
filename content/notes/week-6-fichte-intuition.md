In these notes I discuss some of the particulars of Fichte&rsquo;s conception of
self-positing, along with his view of intellectual intuition, and the comparison of
these ideas with Kant&rsquo;s conception of the self-consciousness of &ldquo;pure apperception.&rdquo;

## <span class="section-num">1</span> Explaining Self-Consciousness {#explaining-self-consciousness}

Fichte&rsquo;s doctrine of intellectual intuition is complex and, in many ways, obscure.
But one issue it clearly addresses is the issue of how and in what way we are
conscious of ourselves. Fichte recognizes that there is a way in which we can all be
conscious of ourselves as _objects_. We can look at our bodies in a mirror. We can see
our bodily position on a map. But Fichte contends we are also aware of ourselves as
_acting subjects_, and this awareness he argues is basic and irreducible to any
awareness of an object.

In a conscious act, such as making a judgment, or moving one&rsquo;s body in an intentional
manner, one need not employ an explicit representation of oneself (e.g. one need not
judge _I think that it is raining_ in order to consciously judge that _It is raining_.
However, it is also true that in any such act one _can_ be conscious that it is oneself
that is so acting. How is this possible? How is it that one can be conscious of some
act or state as one&rsquo;s own?

Fichte contends that the dominant model of how such acts or states become
self-conscious is a &ldquo;reflective&rdquo; one. According to this reflective model one becomes
self-conscious through a process of attending to a conscious experience and
reflecting on it. One is conscious of oneself (the referent of &rsquo;I&rsquo;) insofar as one is
able to reflect on and abstract from some conscious state or act to the awareness of
that act or state as one&rsquo;s own. Both the Wolffian and Reinholdian conceptions of
self-consciousness endorse this reflective model. For such models self-consciousness
is derivative from conscious experience of an object as such. According to Wolff, to
be conscious of an object is to distinguish it from others. In distinguishing an
object from others we become aware of our own activity of distinguishing, and
thereby, of ourselves. This could not happen without an awareness of outer objects.
According to Reinhold self-awareness is made possible by distinguishing the
&ldquo;representing thing that thinks from the representing thing that is thought&rdquo; (NE
1:197). So Reinhold, like Wolff, also construes self-consciousness as dependent on
prior (metaphysically if not temporally) mental acts.

It is Fichte&rsquo;s contention that the reflection theory of self-consciousness is
entirely wrong-headed. On the one hand it presupposes what it seeks to explain. We
see this by asking what it is that is reflected up in order to achieve consciousness
of oneself? If it is the subject---the referent of &rsquo;I&rsquo;---then we already have that
which we seek to explain. On the other hand, if reflection provides a consciousness
of self through representation of some object, then we have failed to capture the
_subjectivity_ of being the subject.[^fn:1]


## <span class="section-num">2</span> Fichte&rsquo;s Characterization of Intellectual Intuition {#fichte-and-rsquo-s-characterization-of-intellectual-intuition}

What is intellectual intuition for Fichte? First, it is _immediate_:

> Intellectual intuition is the immediate consciousness that I act and
> of what I do when I act. It is because of this that it is possible for
> me to know something because I do it. (1:463)

Second, intellectual intuition is _ubiquitous_:

> intellectual intuition occurs at every moment of...consciousness. I cannot take a
> step, move hand or foot, without an intellectual intuition of my
> self-consciousness in these acts; only so do I know that I do it, only so do I
> distinguish my action, and myself therein, from the object of action before me.
> (1:463)

Third, it is always _conjoined_ with a sensory representation:

> Like sensory intuition, which never occurs by itself or constitutes a complete
> state of consciousness, this intellectual intuition never occurs alone, however, as
> a complete act of consciousness. ... intellectual intuition is always
> conjoined with some _sensory_ intuition. (1:463-4)

Fourth, there is an identity of intuition and the subject so intuited:

> In the case of the kind of acting now requested of him [i.e. intellectual
> intuition], however, the act of thinking and what is thought of within this act are
> one and the same, and thus his activity must here turn back upon or revert into
> itself. (1:462)

Fifth, intellectual intuition is active or &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo;:

> We do not, however, here wish to limit ourselves simply to drawing inferences;
> instead, let us cite Kant’s own words. On p. 132 he writes: “This representation ‘I
> think’ is an act of spontaneity; that is, it cannot be regarded as belonging to
> sensibility.” (And consequently, I would add, neither can it be ascribed to inner
> sensibility, to which the sort of identity of consciousness described above does
> indeed pertain.) “I call it &rsquo;pure apperception,&rsquo; to distinguish it from (the just
> mentioned) empirical apperception; because it is that self-consciousness which,
> while generating the representation &rsquo;I think&rsquo; (a representation which must be
> capable of accompanying all other representations, _and which in all consciousness
> is one and the same_), cannot itself be accompanied by any further representation.”
> Here we have a clear description of the nature of pure self-consciousness. This
> pure self-consciousness is the same in all consciousness, and thus it is not
> determinable by anything contingent within consciousness. The I that appears within
> pure self-consciousness is determined by nothing but itself, and it is determined
> absolutely. (1:476)

In sum then, intellectual intuition has five features:

1.  Immediacy
2.  Ubiquity
3.  Empirical Conjoinment
4.  Identity
5.  Spontaneity

How is this different from Kant&rsquo;s conception of intellectual intuition?


## <span class="section-num">3</span> Kant on Intellectual Intuition {#kant-on-intellectual-intuition}

Recall that Kant thinks that the concept of a discursive intellect (i.e. our kind of
mind) brings with it a contrast case, that of a _non-discursive_ intellect, or as Kant
calls it, an intuitive intellect or intuitive understanding. For this kind of mind,
in contrast with ours, intellectual intuitions _are_ possible. This is Kant&rsquo;s
conception of the intuitive intellect.[^fn:2] Kant construes the intuitive intellect
as a non-discursive intellectual faculty---&ldquo;an understanding which should cognize
[_erkennen_] its object, not discursively through categories, but intuitively in a
non-sensible intuition&rdquo; (A256/B312). There are four key features of the intuitive
intellect---viz. it is (i) intellectual, (ii) comprehensive, (iii) productive, and
(iv) non-discursive. Let&rsquo;s review what each of these means.

First, a non-sensible intuition, as _intellectual_, would be entirely actively
produced, its intellectual representations a product of its &ldquo;absolutely spontaneous&rdquo;
pure &ldquo;self-activity&rdquo; (_Selbststätigkeit_). This means that the intuitions of an
intuitive intellect would be self-produced rather than derived from affection by
independent beings (or distinct faculties of onself, as with affection in inner
sense; see B72).

Second, being perfectly active in this manner the intuitive intellect would also
thereby be perfectly _comprehensive_, in cognizing all things from their grounds or
causes rather than their effects, for only a receptive faculty would cognize
something from its effect(s) (_Religion Pölitz_ 28:1111 (1783/84); JL 9:65; C
10:130).[^fn:3]

Third, the intuitive intellect is _productive_ of its objects. The productivity of the
intuitive intellect is a correlate of the two features just discussed. Since the
intellectual intuitions of the intuitive intellect are purely a function of its
spontaneous self-activity, and intuition is defined by Kant as a relation to an
actuality (Pr 4:481-2), the intuitive intellect must be able to produce the
very beings it intuits. And since this intuitive intellect would be completely
comprehensive and creative, the things (actualities) it represents would be
represented entirely from their grounds rather than their effects, and indeed as
being grounded in the intuitive intellect itself. As Kant reportedly puts it,

> God cognizes all things by cognizing himself as the ground of all possibility
> (_Religion Pölitz_ (1783/4), 28:1052; cf. /Metaphysik L<sub>1</sub>/ (mid-1770&rsquo;s), 28:328-9;
> _Metaphysik L<sub>2</sub>_ (1790/1), 28:606).[^fn:4]

In cognizing things from their very grounds of possibility, the intuitive intellect
would represent what is essential to any thing---i.e. in terms of that essence or
nature that grounds all of a thing&rsquo;s other possible properties. Moreover, in
representing created things from their essences, the intuitive intellect represents
those things as they are in themselves. Kant therefore plausibly thinks that the only
being that might have such an intellect is God. God would thus intuit reality as it
is in itself. Indeed, Kant often characterizes God&rsquo;s intuition in this manner in his
lectures---e.g., &ldquo;God cognizes things in themselves&rdquo; (29:833; cf. B71-2;
A256/B311--312; A279--280/B335--336).

Finally, an intellect capable of non-sensible intuition would also be _non-discursive_.
What does this mean? Kant characterizes intellectual activity as &rsquo;discursive&rsquo; to
denote the manner in which our discursive understanding acts---viz. moving to and
fro, from part to part, in building a whole---rather than merely as a synonym for
&rsquo;conceptual&rsquo;, &rsquo;linguistic&rsquo;, or &rsquo;rational&rsquo;.[^fn:5] It is this notion he means to
indicate in his characterization of the discursive intellect&rsquo;s activity as that of
&ldquo;running through&rdquo; and &ldquo;gathering together&rdquo; (A99) representations. A non-discursive
intellect, in contrast, exhibits a whole-to-part grasp of its representations.[^fn:6]
This means that in an intellectual intuition the content of any representational
component is determined by the content of the whole, which the intuitive intellect
apprehends &ldquo;all at once&rdquo; (_Religion Pölitz_ (1783/4), 28:1051) via grasp of what Kant
sometimes calls a &ldquo;synthetic universal&rdquo; (CPJ 5:407; cf. RP 28:1267; _Metaphysik L<sub>1</sub>_
28:328; R 4270, 17:489 (1769--76); R6174 18:478 (1780s)). So the intuitive intellect
is non-discursive because it would not engage in the manner of part-to-whole
unification characteristic of discursive activity, instead representing all things
via its holistic comprehension of the synthetic universal.

Given this conception of an intuitive intellect, how different are its intuitions
from Fichte&rsquo;s intellectual intuitions? Both are such as to be immediately related to
their relatum. They are both also spontaneous. However, the similarities seem to end
there, for Fichte&rsquo;s characterization of intellectual intuition as ubiquitous,
conjoined to sense expereince, and identical to its object do not seem to correspond
with Kant&rsquo;s characterizations of intellectual intuition. But if this is right why
might Fichte nevertheless take himself to be expounding a broadly Kantian position?

Fichte gives us some indication:

> The intellectual intuition of which the _Wissenschaftslehre_ speaks is not directed
> toward any sort of being whatsoever; instead, it is directed at an acting -- and
> this is something that Kant does not even mention (except, perhaps, under the name
> “pure apperception”). (1:472)

If we&rsquo;re to take Fichte as his word then, the relevant comparison is not between
Kant&rsquo;s meaning of &ldquo;intellectual intuition&rdquo; and that of Fichte&rsquo;s, but rather Kant&rsquo;s
conception of &ldquo;pure apperception&rdquo; as compared with Fichte&rsquo;s &ldquo;intellectual intuition&rdquo;.


## <span class="section-num">4</span> Kant on Consciousness & Self-Consciousness {#kant-on-consciousness-and-self-consciousness}

In order to best understand Fichte&rsquo;s comparison of his philosophy with Kant&rsquo;s, and in
particular with Kant&rsquo;s conception of pure apperception, we need to have a clearer
understanding of Kant&rsquo;s view on consciousness and self-consciousness.

The notion of consciousness [_Bewußtsein_] plays an important role in
Kant&rsquo;s philosophy. There are, however, several different senses of
&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; in play in Kant&rsquo;s work, not all of which line up with
[contemporary philosophical usage](http://www.iep.utm.edu/consciou/).
Below I detail several of Kant&rsquo;s most central notions and their
differences from and relations to contemporary usage.


### <span class="section-num">4.1</span> Phenomenal Consciousness {#a.-phenomenal-consciousness}

Contemporary philosophical discussions of consciousness typically focus on phenomenal
consciousness, or &ldquo;what it is like&rdquo; to have a conscious experience of a particular
kind (e.g seeing the color red, smelling a rose, etc.). Such [qualitative features of
consciousness](http://www.iep.utm.edu/qualia/) have been of major concern to philosophers in the last several decades.
However, the metaphysical issue of phenomenal consciousness is almost entirely
ignored by Kant, perhaps because he is unconcerned with problems stemming from
commitments to naturalism or physicalism. He seems to attribute all qualitative
characteristics of consciousness to sensation and what he calls &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; (_Gefühl_)
(CJ 5:206). Kant distinguishes between sensation and feeling in terms of an
objective/subjective distinction. Sensations indicate or present features of objects,
distinct from the subject of experience. Feelings, in contrast, present only states
of the subject to consciousness. Kant&rsquo;s typical examples of such feelings include
pain and pleasure (B66-7; CJ 5:189, 203-6).

Thus, while Kant clearly assigns a cognitive role to sensation, and allows that it is
&ldquo;through sensation&rdquo; that we cognitively relate to objects given in sensibility
(A20/B34), he does not focus in any substantive or systematic way on the phenomenal
aspects of sensory consciousness, or how it is exactly that they aid in cognition of
the empirical world.


### <span class="section-num">4.2</span> Discrimination & Differentiation {#discrimination-and-differentiation}

The central notion of &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; with which Kant is concerned is that connected
with discrimination or differentiation. This is the conception of consciousness that
was mostly in use in Kant&rsquo;s time, particularly by his major predecessors [Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/) (1646--1716) and [Christian Wolff](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754), and he gives little
indication that he departs from their general practice.

According to Kant, anything that a subject can discriminate from other things is a
thing of which a subject is or can be conscious (An 7:136-8). Representations which
allow for discrimination and differentiation are &ldquo;clear&rdquo; (_klar_). Representations
that allow not only for the differentiation of one thing from others
(e.g. differentiating one person&rsquo;s face from another&rsquo;s), but also the differentiation
of parts of the thing so discriminated (e.g.  differentiating the different parts of
a person&rsquo;s face) are called &ldquo;distinct&rdquo; (_deutlich_).

Kant does seem to deny, as against the Leibniz-Wolff tradition, that clarity can
simply be _equated_ with consciousness (B414-15, note). His primary motivation for this
position seems to be that he allows that one&rsquo;s discriminatory capacities may outrun
one&rsquo;s capacity for memory or even the explicit articulation of what is so
discriminated. In such cases one does not have a fully clear representation.

Kant&rsquo;s conception of &ldquo;obscure&rdquo; (_dunkel_) representation as that which allows the
subject of the representation to discriminate differentially between aspects of her
environment without any explicit awareness of the basis by which she is doing so,
connects him with the Leibniz-Wolff tradition of recognizing the existence of
_unconscious_ representations (An 7:135-7). Kant conceives of the majority of
representations that we appeal to in order to explain the complex discriminatory
behaviors of living organisms as being &ldquo;obscure&rdquo; in his technical sense. Likening the
mind to a map Kant goes so far as to say that

> The field of sensuous intuitions and sensations of which we are not conscious, even
> though we can undoubtedly conclude that we have them; that is, _obscure_
> representations in the human being (and thus also in animals), is immense. Clear
> representations, on the other hand, contain only infinitely few points of this
> field which lie open to consciousness; so that as it were only a few places on the
> vast map of our mind are _illuminated_. (An 7:135)

Thus, obscure representations, i.e. representations of which we have no direct or
non-inferential awareness, but which must be posited to explain our (and those of
other living beings) fine grained differential discriminatory capacities, constitute
the majority of the mental representations with which the mind busies itself.

Though Kant does not make this point explicit in his discussion of discrimination and
consciousness, it is clear that he takes our capacity to discriminate between objects
and parts of objects to be ultimately based on our sensory representation of those
objects. This means that his views on consciousness as differential discrimination
intersect with his views on phenomenal consciousness in the following manner. Since
we are receptive beings, and the form of our receptivity is sensibility, the ultimate
basis on which we differentially discriminate between objects must be sensory, and
hence on what it is like to perceive those objects. Thus, though Kant seems to take
for granted the fact that conscious beings are in states with a particular phenomenal
character, it must be the clarity and distinctness of this phenomenal character which
allows a conscious subject to differentially discriminate between the various
elements of her environment (see Kant&rsquo;s discussion of aesthetic perfection in the
1801 _Jäsche Logic_, 9:33-9 for relevant discussion).


### <span class="section-num">4.3</span> Self-Consciousness {#self-consciousness}

Kant believes that most of our representations are ones of which we are not directly
aware. They are nevertheless to some degree conscious, since the condition of
ascribing conscious representations to a subject is that they allow differential
discrimination of elements of the subject&rsquo;s environment. Kant seems to think that the
process of making a representation clear, or fully conscious, requires a higher-order
representation of the relevant representation. As Kant says, &ldquo;consciousness is really
the representation that another representation is in me&rdquo; (JL 9:33). Since this
higher-order representation is one of another representation _in me_, Kant&rsquo;s position
here suggests that consciousness requires at least the capacity for
self-consciousness. This position is reinforced by Kant&rsquo;s famous claim in the
Transcendental Deduction of the _Critique of Pure Reason_ that

> The **I think** must **be able** to accompany all my representations; for otherwise
> something would be represented in me that could not be thought at all, which is as
> much as to say that the representation would either be impossible or else at least
> would be nothing for me. (B131-2; emphasis in the original)

Kant might give the impression here of saying that for representation to be possible
for a subject, that subject must possess the capacity for self-ascribing her
representations. If Kant really did endorse this self-ascription condition, then
representation, and thus the capacity for conscious representation, in either of the
phenomenal or discriminatory senses outlined above, would depend on the capacity for
self-consciousness. Since Kant ties the capacity for self-consciousness to
spontaneity (B132, 137, 423), and restricts spontaneity to the class of rational
beings, the demand for self-ascription would seem to deny that any non-rational
animal (e.g. dogs, cats, birds, etc.), at least according to Kant&rsquo;s conception of
such animals as lacking understanding and reason, could have phenomenal or
discriminatory consciousness!

However, there is little evidence to show that Kant endorses the self-ascription
condition. Instead, he distinguishes between two distinct modes in which one is aware
of oneself and one&rsquo;s representations, via &ldquo;inner sense&rdquo; and via &ldquo;apperception&rdquo; (See
@ameriks2000 for extensive discussion). Only the latter form of awareness seems to
demand a capacity for self-ascription. We&rsquo;ll take these two notions in turn.


#### <span class="section-num">4.3.1</span> Inner Sense {#inner-sense}

Inner sense is, according to Kant, the means by which we are aware of alterations in
our own state. Hence all sensations, including such basic alterations as pleasure and
pain, as well as moods and feelings, are all the proper subject matter of inner
sense. Ultimately, Kant argues that not only all sensations and feelings, but all
representations attributable to a subject whatsoever must ultimately occur in inner
sense and conform to its form, time (A22-3/B37; A34/B51).

Thus, to be aware of something in inner sense is minimally, and at least in the case
of the awareness of sensations and feelings, to be phenomenally conscious. To say
that a subject is aware of her own states via inner sense is to say that she has (at
least) a temporally ordered series of mental states, each of which she is
phenomenally conscious, though she may not be conscious of the series as a whole.
This could still count as a kind of self-awareness, as when an animals is aware of
being in pain. But it is not an awareness of subject as a _self_. Kant himself
indicates such a position in a letter to his friend and former student Marcus Herz
in 1789.

> [representations] could still (I consider myself as an animal) carry on their play
> in an orderly fashion, as connected according to empirical laws of association, and
> thus they could even have influence on my feeling and desire, without my being
> aware of my own existence [_meines Daseins unbewußt_] (assuming that I am even
> conscious of each individual representation, but not of their relation to the unity
> of representation of their object, by means of the synthetic unity of their
> apperception). This might be so without my cognizing the slightest thing thereby,
> not even what my own condition is (C 11:52, May 26, 1789).

Hence, according to Kant, one may be aware of one&rsquo;s representations via inner sense,
but one is not and cannot via inner sense alone aware of oneself as the _subject_ of
those representations. That requires what Kant, following Leibniz [-@leibniz1996]
calls &ldquo;apperception&rdquo;.


#### <span class="section-num">4.3.2</span> Apperception {#apperception}

Kant uses the term &ldquo;apperception&rdquo; to denote the capacity for the awareness of some
state or modification of one&rsquo;s self as just such a state. For a being capable of
apperception, there is a difference between feeling a pain, and thus being aware of
it in inner sense, and apperceiving that one is in pain, and thus ascribing, or being
in a position to ascribe, a certain property or state of mind to one&rsquo;s self. In the
example above, of a non-apperceptive animal as being aware of its own pain, while
there is something (in this case rather unpleasant) it is like to be the animal, and
the animal is itself aware of this -- the pain, and its awareness is partially
explanatory of its behavior (e.g. avoidance), Kant construes the animal as incapable
of making any self-attribution of its pain. Kant seems to think of such a mind as
incapable of construing itself as a subject of states, and thus as unable to construe
itself as persisting through changes of those states. This is not necessarily to say
that an animal incapable of apperception lacks any subject or self. But, at the very
least, such an animal would be incapable of conceiving or representing itself in this
way (See @naragon1990; @mclear2011).

Kant considers the capacity for apperception as importantly tied to the capacity to
represent objects as complexes of properties attributable to a single underlying
entity (e.g. an apple as a subject of the complex of the properties _red_ and _round_).
Kant&rsquo;s argument for this connection is notorious both for its complexity and for its
obscurity.

At least by the publication of the first _Critique_, Kant denies that we can have
anything like a privileged (empirical) _intuition_ of the self. Despite this, the
centrality of what Kant calls the &ldquo;transcendental unity of apperception&rdquo; cannot be
denied. However, one important difference from Kant&rsquo;s pre-critical view, especially
in the _Inaugural Dissertation_, is that the awareness in the pure apperception of
oneself as subject is wholly intellectual rather than sensible. For example, Kant
says,

> this representation [viz. the &ldquo;I think&rdquo;] is an act [_Actus_] of
> spontaneity, i.e., it cannot be regarded as belonging to sensibility.
> (B-Deduction §16, B132)
>
> In the transcendental synthesis of the manifold of representations in
> general, on the contrary, hence in the synthetic original unity of
> apperception, I am conscious of myself not as I appear to myself, nor
> as I am in myself, but only that I am. This representation is a
> thinking, not an intuiting. (B-Deduction §25, B157)
>
> The consciousness of myself in the representation I is no intuition at
> all, but a merely intellectual representation of the self-activity of
> a thinking subject. (Refutation of Idealism, B278)
>
> if I have called the proposition &ldquo;I think&rdquo; an empirical proposition, I
> would not say by this that the I in this proposition is an empirical
> representation; for it is rather purely intellectual, because it
> belongs to thinking in general. (Refutation of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Proof of
> the Persistence of the Soul, B423)

Kant&rsquo;s position in these passages is that the awareness of oneself as the subject of
mental activity is not sensory, but rather a special form of intellectual
representation, one that is neither judgmental or conceptual but the basis for both.
Kant terms this activity of intellectual self-consciousness &ldquo;pure
apperception.&rdquo;[^fn:7] The critical Kant thus endorses two important claims. First, he
holds that self-consciousness is fundamentally _bifurcated_ into sensory (i.e. inner
intuition) and non-sensory (i.e. pure apperception) modes.[^fn:8] Second, he holds
that the sensory mode does not present a metaphysical subject---indeed it presents no
subject at all, and that it is only in pure apperception that one&rsquo;s self is
presented, albeit in not in a manner that supports various inferences of interest to
the &ldquo;rational psychologist&rdquo; (more on this below).


## <span class="section-num">5</span> Kant & Fichte {#kant-and-fichte}

So how should we evaluate the question of whether Kant and Fichte agree concerning
the nature of intellectual intuition? Certainly they would disagree concerning the
_name_ &ldquo;intellectual intuition&rdquo;. But, as Fichte says (echoing Kant), &ldquo;there are no
classical authors in philosophy&rdquo; (1:472). He can use the term even if he uses it in a
manner different from Kant.

Putting the terminological differences to the side, Fichte and Kant seem to _agree_
concerning those aspects of self-consciousness that relate to what Kant calls &ldquo;pure
apperception&rdquo;. Kant considers pure apperception to be an entirely intellectual
awareness of one&rsquo;s self-activity that is immediate and spontaneous. It is also
ubiquitous in the sense that the &ldquo;I think&rdquo; must always be able to accompany one&rsquo;s
representations (B131-2). Kant also accepts that pure apperception must always be
conjoined with some empirical consciousness.

So Kant and Fichte agree that there is a kind of self-consciousness that is
immediate, ubiquitous, empirically conjoined, and spontaneous. There are, however,
two points concerning which it is much less clear that they agree. These are (i) whether
the act of pure apperception is identical with what is appercieved; (ii) whether what
is so appercieved is a _being_ or an _activity_. Fichte is clear that what is purely
appercieved or intellectually intuited is identical with the act of so intuiting and
is an activity rather than a being.

> no real _being, no subsistence or continuing existence_, pertains to the intellect;
> for such being is the result of a process of interaction, and nothing yet exists or
> is assumed to be present with which the intellect could be posited to interact.
> Idealism considers the intellect to be a kind of _doing_ and absolutely nothing more.
> One should not even call it an _active subject_, for such an appellation suggests the
> presence of something that continues to exist and in which an activity inheres. (FI
> 1:440)

In contrast, Kant is much more equivocal as to the nature of the representational act
and what it is one is conscious of in or through that act. Concerning the issue of
act-object identity Kant says that &ldquo;this representation [viz. the “I think”] is an
act [_Actus_] of spontaneity&rdquo; (B132), which would support agreement with Fichte. But
Kant also says that &ldquo;the representation I is no intuition at all, but a merely
intellectual representation of the self-activity of a thinking subject&rdquo; (B278), which
seems best read as disintguishing the I, as representation, from what it is a
representation _of_, viz. the self-activity of the subject.

Kant remarks concerning the priority of being over activity are also mixed. For
example, he says that &ldquo;in the consciousness of myself in mere thinking I am the **being
itself**&rdquo; (B429; emphasis in original) and that &ldquo;I am conscious of myself not as I
appear to myself, nor as I am in myself, but only that I am. This representation is a
thinking, not an intuiting&rdquo; (B-Deduction §25, B157). Both of these claims suggest
that what it is one is conscious of is a being, of whose existence (though not its
nature) one can be certain. Moreover, that Kant conceives of this consciousness in
terms of the existence of a substance is indicated by remarks in the _Pölitz Religion_
lectures, where he says, for example, that

> when I think, I am conscious that my I, and not some other thing,
> thinks in me. Thus I infer that this thinking in me does not inhere in
> another thing external to me but in myself, and consequently also that
> I am a substance, i.e. that I exist for myself, without being the
> predicate of another thing. (_Religion Pölitz_ 28:1042 (1783/84))

Here we see Kant claiming that in self-consciousness we are aware of ourselves as
subjects of inherence rather than as inhering accidents. And in a lectures prior to
the publication of the first _Critique_ Kant says,

> When I say: I think, I act, etc., then either the word I is applied
> falsely, or I am free. Were I not free, then I could not say: I do it,
> but rather I would have to say: I feel in me a desire to do, which
> someone has aroused in me. But when I say: I do it, that means
> spontaneity in the transcendental sense <\emph{in sensu transcendentali}>,
> But now I am conscious to myself that I can say: I do; therefore I am
> conscious of no determination in me, and thus I act absolutely freely.
> (_Metaphysik L\_1_ (1777-80) 28:268)

If we don&rsquo;t reject the pre-critical text as a position Kant renounces, we can tie
these remarks together with his remarks in the _Religion_ and in the first _Critique_ as
follows. In the pure consciousness of one&rsquo;s self-activity one is aware of onself
acting, and thus is conscious of oneself as the ultimate causal locus for the act.
This is equivalent to being determined by nothing else to act, and thus as being
substantial (because ultimate) and free (because undetermined by anything external).

Further complicating matters is the fact that Kant construes the notion of an act
(_Handlung_) as closely connected with the concepts of activity (_Tätigkeit_), substance,
and force (_Kraft_).[^fn:9] Kant&rsquo;s critical conception of causality is also closely
linked to these notions. As he puts it, an act (_Handlung_) &ldquo;already signifies the
relation of the subject of causality to the effect&rdquo; (A205/B250). What is an &ldquo;act&rdquo;?
Kant provides the clearest description in metaphysics lectures from the Critical
period:

> Action [_Handeln_] and effect [_Wirkung_] can only be ascribed to substance. Action is
> the determination of the force [_Kraft_] of a substance as a cause of a certain
> accident [_accidentis_]. Causality [_Causalitas_] is the characteristic of a substance
> insofar as it is considered as the cause of an accident [_accidentis_] (_Metaphysik
> Pölitz_ 28:564-5 (1790/1)).[^fn:10]

Thus, while it is true that Kant, in contrast to Fichte, puts being rather than
acting at the basis of one&rsquo;s existence, it is actually difficult to determine
whether this is a genuinely different position rather than a merely terminological
difference. Kant, like Fichte, sees this being as essentially active and it is on the
basis of this activity that such a being counts as a substance.

[^fn:1]: This dilemma for the reflection theory is forcefully argued in (Henrich 1982). See also (Kriegel 2004; Bayne 2004; Duncan 2019). > What “I” is Kant talking about [in his discussion that the &ldquo;I think&rdquo; must be able > to accompany all of one&rsquo;s representations]... ? Is this perhaps the I that the > Kantians have so confidently pieced together from the manifold of representations, > an I that is not contained in any of these individual representations but is > contained within all of them taken together? If this were so, then the words we > have quoted from Kant would mean _this_: “I who am thinking of D am the same I who > previously thought of C, B, and A; and it is by thinking of my various acts of > thinking that I first become for n an I — i.e., that which remains identical within > this manifold.” If this is what Kant means, then he too would be as wretched a > babbler as the “Kantians” whom we are discussing; for he would then be contending > that the very possibility of all thinking is itself conditioned by another act of > thinking, and indeed, by the act of thinking of this act of thinking. If so, then I > should like to know how we are ever supposed to be able to accomplish a single act > of thinking! (1:475-6) Fichte thus contends that the regress involved in the reflection theorist&rsquo;s thinking of oneself is vicious, and can never explain what it seeks to explain. Fichte argues that instead of treating self-consciousness as in some way derivative of our conscious acts or states we should be construing it as _fundamental_. As Fichte puts it at one point: > the presupposition that self-consciousness is the foundation of all consciousness > completely coincides with the thought of the I as originally posited by itself > (SI 1:462) The act of &ldquo;self positing&rdquo; referred to here is that also referred to by the moniker of &ldquo;intellectual intuition&rdquo;. It is the fact that we are aware of ourselves via intellectual intuition that makes possible the explicit or reflective awareness of ourselves using the first-person concept &rsquo;I&rsquo;. > Intellectual intuition is the immediate consciousness that I act and of what I do > when I act. It is because of this that it is possible for me to know something > because I do it. ... I cannot take a single step, I cannot move my hand or foot, > without the intellectual intuition of my self-consciousness in these actions. It is > only through such an intuition that I know that _I_ do this. Only in this way am I > able to distinguish my own acting (and, within this acting, my own self) from the > encountered object of this acting. (SI 1:463) Fichte contends here that we have an immediate and basic awareness of ourselves in acting that is presupposed by any further complex representational acts or states of consciousness. Though we only have this sort of first-person &ldquo;action awareness&rdquo; insofar as we also are aware of some object of consciousness, the self-consciousness we have in and through intellectual intuition is not reducible to any form of object consciousness or any more basic act or state of the mind.
[^fn:2]: For discussion of the German rationalist conception of an intuitive intellect see (Winegar 2017). I take the intuitive understanding as a faculty for generating intellectual intuitions. Thus there is a conceptual, but not a real, distinction between the intuitive intellect (as ground or faculty) and intellectual intuition (as act of that faculty). For an alternative reading of Kant that sees these terms as marking two distinct faculties see (Ch. Förster 2012, 6).
[^fn:3]: God&rsquo;s representation of all things is thus a priori in the &ldquo;archaic&rdquo; sense of representing a thing from its grounds. The influential _Port Royal Logic_ of Arnauld and Nicole includes a definition of the a priori in terms of the &rsquo;demonstration of effects by their causes&rsquo; (, Arnauld and Nicole 1683, 233). A version of this view arguably is accepted by Leibniz (, Adams 1994, 109; cf. Smit 2009; Hogan 2009, 53–54). Closer to Kant, Wolff provides a general definition of ground in terms of &rsquo;that through which one can understand why something [i.e. what is grounded] is the case&rsquo; (, § Wolff 1720, 29). Moreover, Kant&rsquo;s pre-critical conception of an antecedently determining ground, as articulated in the _New Elucidation_ and elsewhere also seems connected with these older notions (For discussion see Longuenesse 2001, 69–70; Hogan 2009, 53). For extensive defense of the critical Kant&rsquo;s acceptance of an &ldquo;archaic&rdquo; explanatory requirement on the notion of an a priori ground see (Smit 2009, 191–217).
[^fn:4]: The conception of God as the ground of the very possibility of any actual being is a tenet faithfully held by Kant at least from his 1763 _Bewesigrund_ essay on the existence of God. For discussion see (Fisher and Watkins 1998; Adams 2000; Chignell 2009; Yong 2014; Stang 2016).
[^fn:5]: So, _pace_ (Westphal 2000), Kant&rsquo;s conception of the intellect (or the understanding in particular) does not require conceiving of it as a faculty for _concept_ generation. Only discursive faculties are faculties for concept generation (and, correspondingly, for judgment and inference); cf. JL 9:36; CPJ 5:406.
[^fn:6]: Kant understands the whole-to-part merelogical structure of representation as a distinguishing feature of intuition as opposed to conceptual representation, which is part-to-whole. See (Aquila 2001; McLear 2015; Onof and Schulting 2015; McLear and Pereboom 0BC) for discussion.
[^fn:7]: He also occasionally calls pure apperception &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; (e.g. An 7:135n) or &ldquo;transcendental consciousness&rdquo; (e.g. Ref 18:306 (1785--89)).
[^fn:8]: Kant rejects what, in contemporary discussion of this issue, has been called the &ldquo;Uniformity Thesis&rdquo; regarding self-knowledge. See, e.g., [@boyle2009, 141]; cf. [@shoemaker1988]; [@burge1996; -@burge2013-ch16]; [@moran2001].
