In this weeks notes I discuss Kant's position on the intellectual conditions of
cognition---the categories---and their role in his conception of metaphysics.

We've seen that if metaphysics is to be a science, it must, like all science, rely on
one or more synthetic a priori cognitions. Kant argues that such cognition requires
two elements, a set of sensible "forms"---the sensible representations of space and
time---and a set of intellectual forms---the conceptual representations Kant calls
the categories.


# 1. What are "categories"? {#1-dot-what-are-categories}

The notion of a "category" largely springs from Aristotle, and laregly from three
texts: _Categories_, _Topics_ I, and _Metaphysics_ V. Exactly how Aristotle thinks of a
category is controversial (for overviews see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/) and [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/categories/); for the medieval
development of his views see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-categories/)). Perhaps the least controversial thing to say is
that Aristotle advances a position---call it "categorialism"---which says that any
answer to the question "what is there?" must be put in terms of a kind, genus, or
category. Hence, to advance categorialism is to advance the claim that existence or
being has a structure, and the categories delineate that structure.

For Kant, the categories are _concepts_, albeit special kinds of concepts. They are the
most _basic_ concepts of an object. So if we think of <object> as being the most
general or "highest" concept, the categories are the most basic ways in which we
specify the content of <object>.

The categories are _non-empirical_ or "pure", and are _a priori_. This is to say that
neither their content, nor the conditions of their justification, depends on sensory
experience. Nevertheless, Kant considers the categories to be acquired rather than
innate. Indeed, Kant is explicit that neither the categories nor the forms of
intuition are innately possessed by the subject upon its creation (OD 8:222–3).
Concerning the categories themselves, Kant speaks of their “givenness”
(A728–9/B756–7), as well as the “occasional causes of their generation” (A86/B118).
The act through which we acquire the categories (in the sense of coming to have
representations with categorial content) Kant terms "reflection" (_Überlegung_). I'll
say more about reflection, and the derivation of the categories more generally, in
answer to question three, below.

In sum then, the categories are fundamental concepts whose non-empirical and a priori
content is acquired in an act of reflection. Kant thinks there are exactly twelve
categories, and the twelve divide into four "moments" or groups of three. Any
judgment that we make contains a category from one of each of the four groups. These
are:

-   Quantity
    -   Unity
    -   Plurality
    -   Totality
-   Quality
    -   Reality
    -   Negation
    -   Limitation
-   Relation
    -   Inherence-subsistence
    -   Cause-effect
    -   Reciprocity of agent & patient (i.e. "Community")
-   Modality
    -   Possibility
    -   Existence/Actuality
    -   Necessity


# 2. How does Kant understand the relationship between categories and metaphysics? {#2-dot-how-does-kant-understand-the-relationship-between-categories-and-metaphysics}

Since <object> is the most basic concept that the intellect can employ in its
activity, and the categories are the most basic concepts of an object, the categories
are essential to the activity of the intellect in any act of understanding or
comprehending how things are. Kant thus endorses categorialism, at least in the sense
that he construes any answer to the question what is there, that could be understood
by finite thinkers such as ourselves, is one that adverts to the categories. This
might seem to be a merely epistemological or conceptual claim. But Kant construes the
categories to have a genuine ontological upshot.

As Kant puts the point in the second section of the System of the Principles of Pure
Understanding, "The conditions of the **possibility of experience** in general are at the
same time conditions of the **possibility of the objects of experience**" (A158/B197). So
the categories (along with the sensible forms: space and time) are conditions of the
possibility of objects of experience (or what is the same, objects of empirical
cognition). When Kant speaks of a "condition of possibility" here, he means a
condition, not merely of what it is to _think_ of an object, but what it is to _be_ an
object. An "object of the senses" or "phenomenon" is a causally unitary,
spatiotemporally persisting substance whose present complex of interrelated
properties are a function of its causal nature and its causal history, which is in
thoroughgoing law-governed community with other objects, and which is made of stuff
that cannot come into or go out of existence absolutely."[^fn:1] That is, an object of
the senses is what it is in virtue of falling under the ("schematized", or temporally
informed) categories. More generally, an _object_, whether of the senses or not, must
be something that falls under the categories, even in their "unschematized" or pure
non-empirical form. For example, consider the category `<substance-inherence>`.[^fn:2]
Nothing can _be_ an object unless it is the kind of being that both substands and
subsists, which is to say that it is both that in which properties inhere, and which
exists independently of (in the sense of not inhereing in) other things. In this
sense `<substance-inherence>` is not only maximally general, in the sense that there is
no more basic contentful concept than it, but also metaphysically fundamental.
Anything that is or could be an object is either a subject of inherence or inheres in
some subject. Hence, in applying the category of substance one is employing not only
a maximally general way of _thinking about_ a being, but also designating a maximally
fundamental fact _about being_ (i.e. what it is to be) itself. A similar point holds
for all of the other categories.[^fn:3] The categories are thus _both_ the discursively
fundamental ways of representing objects, and the ways of representing what is
fundamental _about_ objects.


# 3. How does Kant derive the categories? {#3-dot-how-does-kant-derive-the-categories}

-   What is a "discursive" understanding?
-   What is an "intuitive" understanding?
-   What are forms of judgment?
-   What is the relation between the categories and the forms of judgment?
-   What is the import of Kant's conception of the nature and derivation of the
    categories for his conception of metaphysics (and metaphysical knowledge)?

Sections 9-12 of the first chapter of the Analytic of Concepts in the _Critique of
Pure Reason_ form what is typically called the "Metaphysical Deduction"---a name which
Kant applies to it, though only later in the _Critique_ (see B159). The purpose of
these sections is to argue for two points. First, that of the a priori concepts we
have available to us, some are more fundamental than others. These are the concepts
Kant calls the "categories." Second, that the categories derive their content from a
non-sensory source---namely, the structure of judgment itself. In making these
arguments the basic question that Kant seeks to answer is the question of _which_ a
priori concepts serve as the fundamental concepts of metaphysical theorizing, and to
explain how we are able to think thoughts using those concepts. The MD provides what
Kant calls a "clue" (more literally a "_Leitfaden_", or "guiding thread") to the
discovery of these concepts. The MD has three sections. These consist of (i) an
introduction where the notion of a "logical use" of the faculty of concepts or the
"understanding" is set out; (ii) an elaboration of the different logical forms of
judgment and a corresponding table of those forms; (iii) an explication of the
categories as a priori concepts that correspond to the various logical forms of the
table as set out in (ii).

Kant's strategy in the MD is to argue that the categories are the most fundamental
concepts in our thought of objects because they are the concepts that are directly
linked to the various basic operations of which the understanding (the faculty of
concepts) is capable. Such operations are all forms of "judgment", and Kant construes
such forms as providing the basis for determining which concepts are fundamental
(i.e. the categories) and how those concepts get their non-empirical content. In
order that we properly appreciate why Kant chooses this strategy for defending his
choice of categories it helps to look at a prior attempt Kant makes for determining
the basic concepts of metaphysics.


## The Pre-Critical Strategy {#the-pre-critical-strategy}

In Kant's "Inaugural Dissertation" (ID) of 1770 (whose formal title is "_On the Forms
and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World_"), which is his last major work
in metaphysics before the publication of the first _Critique_ in 1781, he lays out a
theory of the manner in which the structure of the rational human mind explains what
(and how) it can know of reality. In many ways this work anticipates positions and
arguments Kant provides in the 1781 _Critique of Pure Reason_. And like that latter
work, in the ID Kant seeks to delimit the fundamental concepts of metaphysics (though
he does not in the ID call them categories) via an analysis of the faculty of
understanding (or "intellect" more broadly). He says,

> the concepts met with in metaphysics are not to be sought in the
> senses but in the very nature of the pure understanding, and that not
> as innate concepts but as concepts abstracted from the laws inherent
> in the mind (by attending to its actions on the occasion of an
> experience), and therefore as acquired concepts. (ID §8, 2:395; see
> also ID Corollary, 2:406 and ID §23, 2:411)

Here Kant articulates (or perhaps "gestures at" is more accurate) his view of how the
concepts of metaphysics, through which we think of the intelligible world, are
acquired. They are acquired by attending to the actions of the mind in course of its
having experience. This notion of attending to the actions of the mind is also
referred to by Kant as "reflection" (_reflexion_, _Überlegung, /reflexio_). So, in the ID,
Kant pursues a method of reflection as the basis for explaining how we acquire
contentful concepts for use in metaphysics, and the object of reflection is the mind
and its actions.

It is important for Kant's project in the _Dissertation_, as it will be for his project
in the _Critique of Pure Reason_, that his account of the acquisition of the concepts
of metaphysics not run afoul of his characterization of those concepts as
"intellectual" rather than "empirical" or "sensitive."[^fn:4] For this reason they
cannot be concepts abstracted from sensible intuition, e.g., in the manner that our
concepts of space and time, or of empirical properties are. If they _were_ abstracted
from experience such concepts would be (merely) empirical or "sensitive on account of
their genesis" (ID §5, 2:393). Instead, the concepts of metaphysics are supposed to
be derived from the nature of the pure understanding, or as he elsewhere says, "given
in a fundamental fashion by the pure understanding itself" (ID §23, 2:411). There is,
however, some question as to whether, in the _Dissertation_ or even in his lectures
immediately subsequent to its publication, Kant in fact succeeds in providing an
account of the acquisition of the fundamental concepts of metaphysics consistent with
his stricture on their intellectual provenance.

The account of the _Dissertation_ requires that Kant provide some story as to
how we can come to be aware of the mind and its acts, and on what basis this
awareness constitutes the acquisition of a non-sensory concept. At this point
in his career, Kant has not yet articulated his doctrine of "pure"
apperception as distinct from inner sense (more on this in the next set of
notes). So it looks as if, given his distinction between intuition and concept
and their related faculties, that it must be an _inner intuition_ that accounts
for the acquisition of the concepts of metaphysics. However, if it _is_ inner
intuition that is the basis for such acquisition, it looks like Kant will run
afoul of his requirement that the concepts of metaphysics be intellectual as
opposed to empirical (for even the "pure" concepts of space and time, though
free of sensation, are nevertheless _sensitive_ on account of being derived from
intuition (see, e.g., ID §5, 2:393)).

Perhaps Kant thinks we have a special _intellectual_ intuition of the mind and
its acts? One recent commentator [@dyck2016] has argued that Kant is committed
in the _Dissertation_ to our having intellectual intuitions of our own minds and
that he only subsequently, in the later 70s, rejects this position in favor of
one according to which it is inner _sense_---and thus empirical
psychology---that provides the requisite basis for acquiring metaphysical
concepts. Dyck's argument concerning Kant's position in the _Dissertation_
hinges on two claims. First, that there are clear texts showing that Kant
denies that sensible laws (i.e. of time and space) apply to immaterial
substances, including the mind/soul [see @dyck2016, 330]. Second, that Kant's
conception of the acquisition of the pure concepts of metaphysics depends on
the existence of intellectual intuition of the mind or soul itself
[see @dyck2016, 330-1]. However, neither of these interpretive points are
particularly compelling. Against the first, it is relatively clear from the
context of Kant's statements regarding immaterial substance that he denies
that the principles of the _corporeal_ world apply to such substances (ID §27,
2:414). That would mean that principles belonging to substances understood as
_bodies_ do not apply to the mind. But this is compatible with the conception of
the mind as nevertheless governed by other sensible principles, and in
particular, by time. Against Dyck's second point, in the _Dissertation_ Kant
explicitly states that finite beings lack intellectual intuition (ID §10,
2:396-7) and that "the accidents which are not included in the relations of
space, such as the thoughts of the mind" are in time (ID Corollary, 2:406). It
thus seems unlikely that Kant holds in the _Dissertation_ that metaphysical
concepts are acquired via intellectual intuition, on pain of explicitly
contradicting himself at multiple points.[^fn:5]

But even if Kant does not directly contradict himself in the _Dissertation_,
Dyck's discussion helps point us to a clear tension and perhaps fatal
ambiguity in Kant's pre-critical view. One might, therefore, have hope that
Kant's remarks in lectures and notes subsequent to the publication of the
_Dissertation_ clarify his position. However, the lecture texts we have from the
1770s only make matters more complicated. For example, in lectures shortly
after the _Dissertation_ Kant says, "We have no intuition in the whole world
except the intuition of our self; all other things are appearances"
(_Anthropologie Collins_ 25:15 (1772-3)). Kant's point here is _not_ that we have
only one intuition---viz. of ourselves. Rather, it is that all of our _outer_
intuitions are of appearances, while our inner (and non-intellectual!)
intuitions present ourselves as _substantial subjects_. In a reflexion also from
the early-to-mid 1770s Kant says that "The I is the intuition of a substance"
(R4493, 17:571 (1772-5)). In the _Metaphysics L<sub>1</sub>_ lectures, from roughly the
same period, Kant contrasts consciousness of external objects with
consciousness of the self. One intuits oneself immediately, but the same is
not true of external objects (28:206-7, 224). The self (as intelligence) so
intuited is substantial, simple, and immaterial (28:224-5).

In a note (R4674) from the _Duisberg Nachlass_ of 1775-6, Kant writes that an
(external) object may be represented only "according to its relations", i.e.,
only according to the properties, and relations between those properties, that
are presented in sense experience.[^fn:6] And, as he does in the
lecture material cited above, Kant _contrasts_ our position with respect to
intuition of external objects with the special access we have to ourselves.
The inner intuition of oneself is of an object whose properties are not
presented, as outer things are, merely in terms of relations.[^fn:7]
The language Kant uses in R4674 is also echoed in other texts from the
mid-70s, For example, Kant states that the 'I' is the "original concept" of
substance which we "borrow" for use in our conception of other substances
(_Metaphysics L<sub>1</sub>_, 28:225-6). Relatedly, he remarks that "the I expresses the
substantial; for that substrate in which all accidents inhere is the
substantial. This is the only case where we can immediately intuit the
substance" (_Pölitz Metaphysik_ 28:226 (1777-80)).

The view that emerges from these texts, and that may in fact already be
present in Kant's _Dissertation_, is one according to which inner sense provides
a privileged epistemic relation to oneself. In inner sense one is presented
not merely as a set of relations, as in outer sense, but as a _subject_ of
properties, as what Kant sometimes describes as an intelligence or "thinking
substance" (e.g. _Metaphysics L<sub>1</sub>_ 28:224-5). The self is thus the "original
of all objects" in the sense that, as Allison Laywine puts it, "we somehow
transfer our representations of the one true subject and apply it derivatively
or by analogy to our thought of anything else."[^fn:8]

Unfortunately, Kant never clarifies how this position concerning the
privileged and peculiar role of inner sense is consistent with his general
doctrine of sensible intuition, or how it is consistent with the
_Dissertation's_ position that no pure intellectual concept can be derived from
the content of sensible intuition. The overall impression of Kant's position
based on his remarks in the Dissertation, and subsequently in the lectures, is
that of a steadfast commitment to roughly the following position.
Introspection provides a form of intuitive acquaintance with the self as a
metaphysical subject, and it is via this acquaintance that we can then form by
analogy the representations of objects (construed as metaphysical subjects of
properties) distinct from us. But how this position is ultimately supposed to
cohere with Kant's other commitments in the 70s is, at best, unclear. It in
facts seems a reasonable suspicion that Kant's various commitments in the 70s
_don't_ cohere, and that this resulting tension in his view is part of what
pushes him towards the critical distinction between inner intuition and pure
apperception. We'll talk about this distinction further when we discuss the
argument of the Transcendental Deduction. In the next section I talk about
Kant's revision of his _Dissertation_ strategy in the _Critique_ for the argument
of the MD.


## The Critical Strategy {#the-critical-strategy}

In the _Dissertation_ Kant distinguishes between what he terms the "logical" and
the "real" uses of the understanding (ID §23, 2:410–11). He says,

> in pure philosophy, such as metaphysics, the use of the understanding in
> dealing with principles is real; that is to say, the fundamental concepts of
> things and of relations, and the axioms themselves, are given in a fundamental
> fashion by the pure understanding itself; and, since they are not intuitions,
> they are not immune to error.

In the first _Critique_ Kant maintains the view that the concepts of metaphysics
come from the understanding. However, he significantly alters the method by
which these concepts are derived. Specifically he now closely links the
categories with the logical forms of judgment. The latter are not just a
"clue" to the organization of the table of categories, they _are_ the
categories, at least in their "logical" use. The central texts making this
plain are as follows.

> The same understanding, therefore, and indeed by means of the very same
> actions through which it brings the logical form of a judgment into
> concepts...also brings a transcendental content into its representations by
> means of the synthetic unity of the manifold in intuition in general...(MD
> §10, B105)
>
> [The categories] are concepts of an object in general, by means of
> which its intuition is regarded as determined with regard to one of
> the logical functions for judgments. (TD Transition, B128)
>
> That action of the understanding...through which the manifold of given
> representations (whether they be intuitions or concepts) is brought
> under an apperception in general, is the logical function of
> judgments. ... But now the categories are nothing other than these
> very functions for judging, insofar as the manifold of a given
> intuition is determined with regard to them (TD §20, B143)
>
> In the metaphysical deduction the origin of the a priori categories in
> general was established through their complete coincidence [_völlige
> Zusammentreffung_] with the universal logical functions of thinking
> (TD §26, B159)
>
> the pure concepts of the understanding are, of themselves, nothing but
> logical functions, but that as such they do not constitute the least
> concept of an object in itself but rather need sensory intuition as a
> basis, and even then they serve only to determine empirical judgments
> (Pr §39, 4:324)

These texts communicate two important points. First, they indicate Kant's
pursuit of a strategy for explaining how the pure categories, or fundamental
concepts of metaphysics, arise from the intellect. This strategy avoids
commitment to any form of content nativism, and it avoids the problem that we
saw plagued Kant's account in the _Dissertation_---viz. explaining how the pure
categories are "pure" in the sense of being traceable only to the intellect,
without thereby implicating either intellectual intuition, which he denies, or
sensible (inner) intuition, which would undermine their claim to purity.

Pursuit of this strategy means that, second, the very logical functions for
combining representations (concepts) in judgment, and which constitute the
basis of study in what Kant calls "pure general logic", are also the functions
for combining representations (intuitions) in our experience of objects. Thus
for the understanding as a faculty of judging (A69/B94), each logical function
of thinking (e.g. categorical judgment), when applied to a multiplicity of
intuitions, results in a distinctive way of relating to, or "experiencing" in
Kant's technical sense, an object e.g. a substance.

Thus, Kant has a much more coherent strategy than he did in the _Dissertation_
for explaining how we come to grasp the a priori concepts necessary for doing
metaphysics. The notion that we can analyze our logic and determine which are
the basic logical forms is plausible and does not require appealing to some
privileged access we might have to ourselves in introspection (i.e. inner
sense).

However, for this strategy to ultimately succeed, Kant must provide
substantial arguments for several controversial claims. First, he must show
that he has successfully given a complete analysis of the logical forms of
judgment; second, he must show that the metaphysical concepts derived from
these logical forms (i.e. the categories) really provide the complete basis
for doing metaphysics; third, he must show that the content of the categories
does not include material absent from the purely logical forms---if there
were such "extra" content in the categories, then it is not clear how they are
supposed to be "identical" with the logical forms, as Kant sometimes indicates
that they are.

Unfortunately Kant fails to meet any of these requirements in the MD. There is
no formal demonstration of the completeness of either the table of judgment
or, correspondingly, the categories. There is likewise no demonstration
provided that shows that all and only these categories provide the basic
materials for metaphysics. Finally, it is not obvious that the content of the
categories is simply "identical" with that of the forms of judgment.

To take just one example, Kant construes the category of substance as related
to the form of categorical (i.e. subject/predicate) judgment. The purely
logical or grammatical notion is thus of a term or concept that can only
occupy subject position and never predicate position. However, this notion
does not adequately capture central ways in which Kant uses the concept
<substance>. More specifically, Kant construes a substance as substanding and
subsisting. This means that (i) substance is a being in which things "_inhere_"
and (ii) substance does not itself inhere in anything else (in this
circumscribed sense substance is an independent being). Kant construes
inherence as a real (that is, non-logical) asymmetric dependence relation
between a subject of inherence (the substance) and its properties or modes
(i.e. the way or ways in which the subject exists). The purely logical or
grammatical conception of substance as a subject term that is never a
predicate term fails to properly capture this dependence relation, for it
fails to show how a predicate term might asymmetrically depend on a subject
term in a manner that models the metaphysical relation between substance and
mode.

In the end then, while Kant's strategy in the MD is a clear improvement over
his prior attempt in the _Dissertation_, it is not at all clear that he
successfully defends his claim to have provided a principled and a priori
basis for exhaustively determining which are the fundamental concepts. Kant
wants an argument that,

> has not arisen rhapsodically from a haphazard search for pure concepts, of the completeness of which one could never be certain, since one would only infer it through induction, without reﬂecting that in this way one would never see why just these and not other concepts should inhabit the pure understanding. (A81/B106-7)

Kant does not provide convincing proof of this position in the MD. Whether such a proof could be given is, perhaps, another story.[^fn:9]


# 4. How does Kant justify their application (or applicability)? {#4-dot-how-does-kant-justify-their-application--or-applicability}

Kant thinks that possession of a particular privileged set of a priori
concepts---i.e. the categories---is necessary for knowledge of the empirical world.
But this raises a problem. How could an a priori concept, which is not itself derived
from any experience, be nevertheless legitimately applicable to objects of
experience? To make things even more difficult, it is not the mere possibility of the
application of a priori concepts to objects of experience that worries Kant, for this
could just be a matter of pure luck. Kant requires more than the mere possibility of
application, for he wants to show that with regard to a privileged set of a priori
concepts, they apply necessarily and universally to all objects of experience and do
so in a way that we are in a position to know a priori.

Kant's strategy for demonstrating how this is possible hinges on showing that the experience of objects that he thinks all would agree that we have nevertheless depends on the application of a priori concepts---the categories. Kant makes this clear in his elaboration of his ‘Copernican Turn' in philosophy:

> because I cannot stop with these intuitions, if they are to become cognitions, but must refer them as representations to something as their object and determine this object through them, I can assume either that the concepts through which I bring about this determination also conform to the objects, and then I am once again in the same difficulty about how I could know anything about them _a priori_, or else I assume that the objects, or what is the same thing, the _experience_ in which alone they can be cognized (as given objects) conforms to those concepts, in which case I immediately see an easier way out of the difficulty, since experience itself is a kind of cognition requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to presuppose in myself before any object is given to me, hence _a priori_, which rule is expressed in concepts _a priori_, to which all objects of experience must therefore necessarily conform, and with which they must agree. (CPR Preface, Bxvii)

Kant's strategy is thus to show how a priori concepts legitimately apply to their objects in virtue of being partly constitutive of the objects of experience, rather than the traditional view in which the objects of experience are the ground of our concepts. Now, what exactly this means is deeply contested, at least partly because it is rather unclear what Kant intends us to understand by his Transcendental Idealism. For example, does Kant intend that the objects of experience are _themselves_ nothing other than representations? This would be a form of phenomenalism similar to that offered by [Berkeley](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/). Kant, however, seems to want to deny that his view is similar to Berkeley's, asserting instead that the objects of experience really exist independently of the mind, and that it is only the _way_ that they are experienced that is mind-dependent.

> the fact that I have myself given to this theory of mine the name of
> transcendental idealism cannot justify anyone in confusing it with the
> empirical idealism of _Descartes_ (although this idealism was only a problem,
> whose insolubility left everyone free, in _Descartes_' opinion, to deny the
> existence of the corporeal world, since the problem could never be answered
> satisfactorily) or with the mystical and visionary idealism of _Berkeley_
> (against which, along with other similar fantasies, our _Critique_, on the
> contrary, contains the proper antidote). For what I called idealism did not

> about all _appearances_, I have only shown: that they are not things (but mere
> ways of representing), nor are they determinations that belong to things in
> themselves. (_Prolegomena_ §13, Note III; 4:293)

I'm mostly going to set this issue to the side in what follows. But the issue of
idealism is important to consider, insofar as Kant takes himself to be replying to
the arguments of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume about the nature of the
empirical world and the nature and extent of our knowledge of it.


## What Is a Transcendental Deduction? {#what-is-a-transcendental-deduction}

In order to prove that there are a priori concepts which legitimately apply to the objects of experience, Kant articulates [a special sort of argument](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental/), which he calls a 'transcendental deduction'. As cite:@henrich1989 points out, the notion of a 'deduction' that Kant uses, is a legal one intended to provide a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property claim. In Kant's case however, it is transformed into a justification of the applicability (in the sense discussed above) of the a priori concepts Kant calls the 'categories'. These are the concepts given in Kant's 'Table of Categories' (A80/B106); they are Unity, Plurality, and Totality (the Categories of Quantity); Reality, Negation, and Limitation (the Categories of Quality); Inherence and Subsistence, Causality and Dependence, and Community (the Categories of Relation), and Possibility-Impossibility, Existence-Nonexistence, Necessity-Contingency (the Categories of Modality).

With regard to each category, Kant's aim is to show that it has 'objective validity'---i.e. legitimate applicability to the objects of experience. Disputes concerning various members of the table should be familiar. Hume famously disputes the legitimacy of our concept _cause_. Hume thinks (in Kant's terms) that no 'empirical deduction' of the concept is possible---i.e. that the concept cannot be traced to the occurrence of a corresponding impression. Kant concurs with Hume on this point---that there can be no empirical deduction---but argues that this doesn't show that the concept is illegitimate, for it may be both a priori and legitimately applied in virtue of being a necessary condition of experience.

For Kant then a 'transcendental deduction' starts from a premise concerning some feature of human experience, a premise which reasonable interlocutors might be expected to endorse, and then argues to a substantive philosophical conclusion concerning the presuppositions or necessary conditions of the truth of that premise. Since Kant's concern here is the a priori categories, his aim is to show that a presupposition or necessary condition of some relatively uncontroversial feature of experience is the applicability (or successful application) of the a priori concept(s) in question to the objects of experience. Below we'll concern ourselves with Kant's answer to Hume regarding the objective legitimacy of the concept _cause_.


## Experience & Cognition {#experience-and-cognition}

Kant is concerned with how we might explain and justify the application of a priori concepts to objects of experience. But this question, as it stands, requires still sharper focus. We've seen what Kant means in his question concerning the _legitimacy_ of concepts in their application to the objects of experience. But what does Kant mean by "_experience_" [_Erfahrung_]? Our problem is that the notion of "experience," both in German and in English, is ambiguous and can mean any number of a variety of things---anything from the mere occurrence of sensation all the way to empirical judgment.[^fn:10]

For Kant, "experience" is a technical term that is closely related to _empirical cognition_ [_empirische Erkenntniss_]. He makes this clear at several points, both in the Deduction and elsewhere in the first _Critique_. However, in what exactly the relation between the two notions consists is somewhat problematic. For example, Kant says that

> Such cognitions [i.e. those that are independent of any sense impression] are called _a priori_ cognitions; they are distinguished from empirical cognitions, _whose sources are a posteriori, namely, in experience_ [_Erfahrung_] (Introduction, B2; my emphasis).

Here we see Kant saying that the _source_ of empirical cognition is experience. However, Kant also quite explicitly _identifies_ empirical cognition with experience (or treats the terms synonymously).

> Empirical cognition, however, is experience (B166).
>
> Experience is an empirical cognition, i.e., a cognition that determines an object through perceptions (A176/B218).
>
> Therefore experience itself---i.e., empirical cognition of appearances---is possible only inasmuch as we subject the succession of appearances, and hence all change, to the law of causality (A189/B234).
>
> it [the presentation "I am"] is not yet a cognition of that subject, and hence is also no empirical cognition -- i.e., experience -- of it (B277).

These passages all identify experience with empirical cognition. But if they are
synonymous notions then how could experience be the _source_ of empirical cognition, as
is said in B2? A relatively simple resolution of this problem is to distinguish two
notions of "experience"---between "experience" as the sensory result of affection by
external objects (via outer sense) and oneself (via inner sense) and "experience" as
the result of structuring sense perceptions via the categories. Call the latter,
categorically structured state, "complex experience" (or "C-experience") and the
former state "simple experience" (or S-experience). We can then read B2 as saying
that empirical cognition, which is identical with C-experience, has its source in
S-experience, the material (sensation, intuition, perception) out of which complex
experience is constructed.

This also helps us make sense of B1, where Kant says,

> There is no doubt whatever that all our cognition begins with experience; for how else should the cognitive faculty be awakened into exercise if not through objects that stimulate our senses and in part themselves produce representations, in part bring the activity of our understanding into motion to compare these, to connect or separate them, and thus to work up the raw material of sensible impressions into _a cognition of objects that is called experience_? (my emphasis)

All cognition begins with _simple_ experience, which is "worked up" into cognition of objects (i.e. empirical cognition) or (as I've called it) complex experience.

In §17 of the B-deduction Kant specifies that a cognition consists in the "determinate relation of given representations to an object" (B137). I take this to mean that S-experience---the contents of a sensory intuition---provides consciousness of 'appearances' [_Erscheinungen_] or 'undetermined objects' [_unbestimmte Gegestande_] (A20/B34)---which is then made 'determinate' via the activity of the intellect. The result is _empirical_ cognition of an object. And it is this empirical cognition of objects (and ultimately all cognition of objects whatsoever) that it is the aim of Kant's Deduction to legitimate, for it is this cognition that depends on the categories.

> all empirical cognition of objects necessarily conforms to such concepts [i.e. the categories], because nothing is possible as object of experience unless these concepts are presupposed A93/B126).

Hence, to show that the categories are "objectively valid" or legitimate in their application to any and all objects of possible experience, is for Kant to show that the categories are necessary for empirical cognition of objects, or complex experience. One thing to think about as we move through the argument of the Deduction is whether Kant's conception of C-experience corresponds to anything in the positions of empiricists like Locke and Hume. Do empiricists need to concede the existence of the kind of experience for which Kant thinks the categories are necessary?[^fn:11]

Kant's demonstration of the validity of the categories attempts to wind its way
between two poles which he terms the _enthusiasm_ of Locke and the _skepticism_
of Hume (A94/B127). Locke's enthusiasm lay in the attempted derivation of all
our concepts from the structure of appearances (whether we interpret these
appearances as objects or merely as ideas). But this derivation is, according
to Kant, inconsistent with the conditions for the manifestation of appearances
and led us to improperly apply our concepts beyond their sphere.

In contrast to Locke, Hume denies that the a priori concepts have any
application whatsoever, and thus Hume presents a sort of skeptical alternative
to Locke. Kant's third way argues that the structure of C-experience and the
structure of our concepts are interconnected. His strategy for showing this is
to show that the structure of C-experience and the structure of propositional
judgment have a common root---viz. the unifying activity of the understanding.
The Transcendental Deduction is thus an attempt "to try to find out whether we
cannot provide for human reason safe passage between these two cliffs, assign
to it determinate bounds, and yet keep open for it the entire realm of its
appropriate activity" (A95/B128). How exactly Kant does this requires
explication of the first step of the Deduction, to which we'll now turn.


## Structure of the Deduction {#structure-of-the-deduction}

I take the structure of the deduction to consist of two steps; the first starts at §15 and concludes with §20 (§21 being essentially a recap of the preceding argument). The second step begins with §22 and concludes with §26 (with §27 also being a recapitulation). This "two-step" interpretation is not new, though interpretation of the content of each step and their relations to one another differs widely.[^fn:12]

The first step of the Deduction (§§15-21) argues that _combination_ of representations
cannot be given to the subject via the senses, but is rather something that the
subject does. In order that the combination of representations result in cognition,
Kant then argues that there must be a unitary subject, or _combiner_ of those
representations. The unity condition is satisfied by what Kant calls, in §16, the "original synthetic unity of apperception." In the next three sections (§§17-19) Kant argues that this unity of apperception requires a kind of activity, and that this activity is fundamentally that of the functions of the understanding or the "categories."  He concludes in §20 that (i) since all complex unities require combination; (ii) combination requires the original synthetic unity of apperception; and (iii) the unity of apperception is or essentially requires a kind of categorial activity; that (iv) all (complex) unity, including intuition, depends on, or "stands under" (B143) the categories.

The second step of the Deduction (§§22-7) discusses both positive and negative points raised by the first step. Negatively, Kant argues that the categories are limited to _empirical cognition_ -- i.e. to the cognition of appearances, not things in themselves. This importantly includes even our cognition of _ourselves_ as subjects of consciousness. Positively, Kant argues in §26 that not only does all cognition rest on the application of the categories, but that one and all, appearances _are necessarily_ categorial. He does this be showing that (i) we have a priori cognition of space and time themselves as objects, (ii) that this is only possible via the categories, (iii) and that since all appearances are governed by space and time, any appearance in space and time must also be categorially structured. This means that there is no possibility of an object's appearing (i.e. being "given) that is not susceptible to determination by the categories. If this argument is successful then Kant will have demonstrated both that if we have cognition ("experience" in Kant's technical sense) then it depends on the categories, and that we _do_ have such cognition, since mathematical cognition preuspposes that we cognize space and time as objects.

[^fn:2]: Kant is reported to have said that `<substance>` is the "most preeminent" of the categories and "thus the basis of all other cognition" (_Metaphysik Mrongovius_, 29:769--70).
[^fn:3]: The modal categories are the exception since, as Kant indicates, they are "merely subjectively valid for the human understanding" and "are not valid of objects in general" (CPJ 5:402); see also [@stang2016, ch. 10; @kohl2015c].
[^fn:4]: What are the "concepts of metaphysics" for Kant? Certainly they include the concept `<God>`, as well as `<soul>` and `<world>`. These all presuppose possession of the concept `<substance>`. Presumably also on the list are other concepts one would find in, e.g., Baumgarten's _Metaphysica_, such as `<possibility>`, `<necessity>`, `<accident>`, and so forth.

As (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_19">Mohr 1995, 32–36</a>) points out, Kant does speak of an intellectual (not inner) intuition of freedom in _reflexionen_ from the early-to-mid-1770s (e.g. R4336 17:509 (1769-75)) But Kant also speaks of apperception as opposed to intuition in the mid-1770s (e.g. R4723 17:688 (1773-5); R6860 19:183 (1776?-91?)). It is clear that he is struggling to express the nature of the awareness we can have, as rational beings, of our own activity (e.g. R4220 17:462 (1769-70)).

[^fn:7]: There is also indication in the _Duisburg Nachlaß_, as there was in Kant's lectures, of his endorsement of the rational psychology he would later come to criticize. For example, in the _Nachlaß_ Kant says that "I would not represent anything as outside of me and thus make appearance into experience (objectively) if the representations did not relate to something _that is parallel to my I_, through which I refer them from myself to another subject" (R4675, 17:648 (1775); my emphasis).
