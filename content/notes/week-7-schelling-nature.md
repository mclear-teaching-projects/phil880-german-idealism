In these notes I discuss Schelling&rsquo;s intellectual career and some of the details of
his early _Naturphilosophie_ (philosophy of nature) as it is developed in his _Erster
Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie_ of 1799, (First Outline of a System of the
Philosophy of Nature). I focus on a few particular themes, viz. his conception of
nature, of an organism, and his evolving relation to Spinozism. In next week&rsquo;s notes
we&rsquo;ll focus on his related doctrine concerning intellectual intuition, as well as the
prospects and problems raised by his conception of reality in terms of the
&ldquo;absolute&rdquo;.[^fn:1]

## <span class="section-num">1</span> Who is Schelling? {#who-is-schelling}

Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (1775–1854) is, along with J.G. Fichte and
G.W.F. Hegel, one of the three most influential thinkers in the group of post-Kantian
German Idealists. He played a major role in the development of both Fichte&rsquo;s and
Hegel&rsquo;s philosophies, and his own work constantly challenged positions (both of his
own and others) concerning what philosophy is, what its aims are, and how it should
be practiced. Hegel joked that Schelling undertook his philosophical education in
public, and Schelling&rsquo;s work is often described as &ldquo;protean&rdquo; in the sense of taking a
variety of different forms and concerns, not all of which are obviously compatible
with one another.

Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy is often divided into five periods, though, like all efforts
at periodization, this distinctions are somewhat artificial.[^fn:2]

(i) **The Early Period** (1794-1796). The texts of the mid-1790s are often interpreted as
belonging to a &rsquo;Fichtean&rsquo; period that focuses on the absolute \`I&rsquo; or subject as the
ground of the system of knowledge an d action.

(ii) **The Early Philosophy of Nature** (1797-1800). The work of this period focuses on
the structure of the natural world. Although Schelling continues, during this period,
the broadly &rsquo;Fichtean&rsquo; project of understanding how the mind comes to know nature
(e.g. in the 1800 _System of Transcendental Idealism_), he now argues that philosophy
must also demonstrate how nature comes to be aware of itself through the mind.

(iii) **The Philosophy of Identity** (1801-1805). With the publication of the
_Presentation of My System of Philosophy_, Schelling announces his turn to the
fundamental basis of both his transcendental idealism and his philosophy of nature.
This period of Schelling&rsquo;s thought is often identified as the &rsquo;system of identity&rsquo;,
since it is here that Schelling argues, in broadly spinozistic fashion, that mind and
nature are, at the most basic level of reality, identical.

(iv) **The Middle Period** (1809-1815). In 1809, Schelling publishes his _Philosophical
Investigations into the Essence of Human Freedom_, an essay that marks an important
shift in his philosophical development. While Schelling continues to understand the
absolute in terms of &rsquo;identity&rsquo; he now emphasizes the developmental character of all
that is - even interpreting &rsquo;identity&rsquo; itself as processual. Traditionally, this
period of thought is also interpreted as the beginning of Schelling&rsquo;s focus on
freedom, contingency and that which is in some sense beyond the grasp of reason. It
is particularly with his discussions of freedom and evil that we see Schelling depart
radically from central commitments of other German Idealists, especially Kant and Hegel.

(v) **The Late Period** (1820-1850). The last period of Schelling&rsquo;s thought is distinct
from the earlier work in a number of important ways that all follow from the fact
that Schelling now sets up a distinction between negative and positive philosophy:
the former exhibits the rationally necessary features of reality and the latter
attends to the historical fact of the actual existence of the world, whose character
can only be grasped through experience.

Whistler and Berger (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_19">Whistler and Berger 2020, 7–8</a>) provide the following helpful
overview of Schelling&rsquo;s main characteristic positions:

1.  _Reality has an intelligible structure_. Precisely how one accesses the intelligible
    structure of reality is a difficult issue; however, throughout the whole of his
    life, Schelling insists upon the rational character of being — even when he comes
    to argue that the ultimate ground of being is not immanent to reason. Indeed, on
    attending Schelling&rsquo;s lectures on the positive philosophy, Kierkegaard notes that,
    although \`the world is not a logical consequence of God&rsquo;s nature; for Schelling,
    \`the a priori content of the science of reason is ... the whole of actuality&ldquo;.

2.  _Modern thought must no longer ignore the philosophical significance of nature_. The
    intelligible structure of reality is not limited to the reality of the mind for
    Schelling, but extends to the natural world. For this reason, he is critical of
    what he sees as the unfounded priority given to the philosophy of mind in
    modernity. Philosophy must become, like it once was in ancient physics, attentive
    to the dynamic world of both organic and inorganic nature; it must become, or at
    least come to include, a non-reductionist, non-mechanical philosophy of nature.

3.  _Consciousness is not all that exists; there is an unconscious dimension to
    reality_. Related to Schelling&rsquo;s interest in natural phenomena is his more general
    understanding of consciousness as being in some sense dependent upon non-conscious
    or unconscious processes. This ultimately leads him to the idea that the ultimate
    ground of being is not only unconscious but even arational.

4.  _The basic elements of reality are parts of a whole_. Schelling is a thinker of
    unity, identity and totality, and he argues that the conscious and unconscious
    dimensions of reality can only be understood in terms of their place within a
    unified whole. Although his conception of this unity undergoes important changes
    from one period of thought to the next, he remains committed to some version of
    the slogan of his youth: _hen kai pan_, one is all.

5.  _Works of art exhibit the full truth of reality_. Although it is misleading to
    characterize Schelling as being interested in art over and above philosophy,
    Josiah Royce had good reason to describe him as the &rsquo;prince of the romanticists&rsquo;:
    art is in no way deficient, for Schelling, but is a fully adequate way of
    presenting the structure of being.

6.  _Reality is not, essentially, a \`substance&rsquo; or \`thing, but a dynamic and productive
    process_. Indeed, one reason that art exhibits the full truth of reality is that it
    expresses the unity of all that is through a process of creation. Art is not,
    however, the only aspect of the world that Schelling understands in terms of a
    fundamental creativity. At different points in his career, he foregrounds the
    productive activity of nature, the generation of gods in mythological
    consciousness and God&rsquo;s free and creative activity in history.


## <span class="section-num">2</span> What is _Naturphilosophy_? {#what-is-naturphilosophy}

Schelling&rsquo;s _Naturphilosophie_, or philosophy of nature, is an attempt to articulate
how the self-conscious knowing subject originates from a non-conscious (or perhaps
unconscious) dynamic nature. He calls it &ldquo;speculative physics&rdquo; in order to
differentiate it from empirical natural science. There are two features of it that
make it particularly salient with respect to its opposition to Fichte&rsquo;s philosophy.
First, it is a form of transcendental realism, in the sense that it endorses the
thesis that nature exists independent of all forms of consciousness, even that of the
transcendental subject. Second, it endorses what we might call &ldquo;transcendental
naturalism&rdquo;, the doctrine that everything is explicable according to the laws of
nature, including the rationality of the transcendental subject.[^fn:3] As we&rsquo;ll see,
however, Schelling&rsquo;s conception of &ldquo;nature&rdquo; is radically different from the
mechanical conceptions that were dominant in philosophical and empirical at the time
(and now).


## <span class="section-num">3</span> The Kantian Problematic {#the-kantian-problematic}

In his _Critique of the Power of Judgment_ Kant presents an account of final
causation (teleology) and organisms that is central to the way in which Schelling
frames his account of nature. I&rsquo;ll briefly summarize this account before moving on to
discuss Schelling&rsquo;s position.

Kant considers an &ldquo;end&rdquo; or purpose to be that which is produced by the causality of
a concept, as with, e.g. an artifact. One produces a watch by bringing together
various mechanical parts for the end or purpose of telling time, etc. An end is
thus &ldquo;the object of a concept insofar as the latter is regarded as the cause of the
former&rdquo; (CPJ §10, 5:220). &ldquo;Final&rdquo; causation is causation in which the concept or
representation of the end serves as cause of its effect.

> an end is the object of a concept insofar as the latter is regarded as the cause of
> the former (the real ground of its possibility); and the causality of a **concept**
> with regard to its **object** is purposiveness (_forma ﬁnalis_). Thus where not merely
> the cognition of an object but the object itself (its form or its existence) as an
> effect is thought of as possible only through a concept of the latter, there one
> thinks of an end. The representation of the effect is here the determining ground
> of its cause, and precedes the latter. (CPJ §10, 5:219-20)

Kant contrasts final causation with efficient causation. Efficient causation is
such that the cause is always (logically/metaphysically) prior to the effect. There
is thus an asymmetry in which (as Kant puts it) the effect is &ldquo;subordinated&rdquo; to the
cause.

> The causal nexus, insofar as it is conceived merely by the understanding, is a
> connection that constitutes a series (of causes and effects) that is always
> descending; and the things themselves, which as effects presuppose others as their
> causes, cannot conversely be the causes of these at the same time. This causal
> nexus is called that of efﬁcient causes (_nexus effectivus_). In contrast, however, a
> causal nexus can also be conceived in accordance with a concept of reason (of
> ends), which, if considered as a series, would carry with it descending as well as
> ascending dependency, in which the thing which is on the one hand designated as an
> effect nevertheless deserves, in ascent, the name of a cause of the same thing of
> which it is the effect. In the practical sphere (namely, of art) such a connection
> can readily be found, e.g., the house is certainly the cause of the sums that are
> taken in as rent, while conversely the representation of this possible income was
> the cause of the construction of the house. Such a causal connection is called that
> of ﬁnal causes (_nexus ﬁnalis_). The ﬁrst could perhaps more aptly be called the
> connection of real causes, and the second that of ideal ones, since with this
> terminology it would immediately be grasped that there cannot be more than these
> two kinds of causality. (CPJ §65, 5:372-3)

Final causation with respect to artifacts is not, Kant thinks, remotely mysterious.
The question is whether we should consider final causation to be at work in nature,
apart from the artifice of human agents. Kant calls such products of final
causation in nature &ldquo;natural ends&rdquo;.

> Now for a thing as a natural end it is requisite, ﬁrst, that its parts (as far as
> their existence and their form are concerned) are possible only through their
> relation to the whole. ... then it is required, second, that its parts be combined
> into a whole by being reciprocally the cause and effect of their form. (CPJ §65, 5:373)

There are thus two conditions to a natural end:

Natural end/purpose:
: products of nature that are themselves ends, in which the
    parts are (i) possible in virtue of their relation to the whole; and (ii)
    reciprocally cause one another

Kant&rsquo;s characterization of a natural end as being a whole that determines its parts
and as engaging in reciprocal causation is given its clearest expression in his
notion of an organism, e.g. a tree, which has three features (jointly necessary and
sufficient):

> First, a tree generates another tree in accordance with a known natural
> law. (§64, 5:371)
>
> Second, a tree also generates itself as an individual. This sort of
> effect we call, of course, growth; but this is to be taken in such a way
> that it is entirely distinct from any other increase in magnitude in
> accordance with mechanical laws, and is to be regarded as equivalent,
> although under another name, with generation. (§64, 5:371)
>
> Third, one part of this creature also generates itself in such a way
> that the preservation of the one is reciprocally dependent on the
> preservation of the other. (§64, 5:371)

In short, an organism as a natural end, exhibits the features of (or capacities
thereto):

1.  Reproduction
2.  Self-maintenance/organization
3.  Reciprocal dependence among parts

To explain these features Kant posits what he calls a &ldquo;_Bildungskraft_&rdquo; or &ldquo;formative
power&rdquo; in the organism, that allows it to engage in these kinds of activities.

> An organized being is thus not a mere machine, for that has only a motive power,
> while the organized being possesses in itself a formative power, and indeed one that
> it communicates to the matter, which does not have it (it organizes the latter): thus
> it has a self-propagating formative power, which cannot be explained through the
> capacity for movement alone (that is, mechanism). (CPJ §65, 5:374)

However, Kant&rsquo;s conception of nature leave no room for such a formative power.
Matter, as such, has merely a &ldquo;motive&rdquo; power (i.e. the actuality or possibility of
movement), but not the power to be both cause and effect of itself in the manner
indicated above. This results in what Kant calls an &ldquo;antinomy&rdquo; or conflict of reason
with itself, concerning the accommodation of natural ends, and organisms in
particular, in nature.

The paradoxical character of natural ends/purposes is thus:

-   If something is natural, then it is not the product of design (it is
    not an artifact)
-   If something is an end, then it is produced in accordance with some
    conceptualized aim

This conflict is expressed in the antinomy in terms of two theses:

Thesis:
: All generation of material things is possible in accordance
    with merely mechanical laws.

Antithesis:
: Some generation of such things is not possible in
    accordance with merely mechanical laws.

> The **ﬁrst maxim** of the power of judgment is the **thesis**: All generation of material
> things and their forms must be judged as possible in accordance with merely
> mechanical laws. The **second maxim** is the **antithesis**: Some products of material nature
> cannot be judged as possible according to merely mechanical laws (judging them
> requires an entirely different law of causality, namely that of ﬁnal causes). Now if
> one were to transform these regulative principles for research into constitutive
> principles of the possibility of the objects themselves...as objective principles for
> the determining power of judgment, they would contradict one another, and hence one
> of the two propositions would necessarily be false; but that would then be an
> antinomy, though not of the power of judgment, but rather a conﬂict in the
> legislation of reason. However, reason can prove neither the one nor the other of
> these fundamental principles, because we can have no determining principle a priori
> of the possibility of things in accordance with merely empirical laws of nature.
> (CPJ 5:387)

Kant&rsquo;s solution to the above antinomy is much contested. His strategy for reconciling
the two propositions (thesis and antithesis) seems to hinge on recognizing that the
thesis & antithesis are merely &ldquo;regulative&rdquo; in the sense that they each serve to
unify, simplify and systematize concepts, and direct the understanding (the faculty
of concepts) to its greatest extent, with a view to arriving at a systematically
unified whole of knowledge (a &rsquo;_scientia_ or _Wissenschaft_).

The problem is that, even if we grant Kant the claim that both are regulative, it is
not clear how even if thesis and antithesis are both regulative, that they are
thereby compatible with one another. The unclarity of this putative solution
encouraged philosophers after Kant to think anew the relationship between nature as
conceived by physics and as conceived by biology (or any other teleological science).
As we&rsquo;ll see, Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy of nature aims at just such a reconception and
reconciliation.


## <span class="section-num">4</span> Nature as Productive & as Product {#nature-as-productive-and-as-product}

Though Schelling was greatly influenced by Fichte&rsquo;s work, Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy of
nature expresses several ideas that ultimately would pull Schelling away from
Fichte&rsquo;s philosophy, and indeed in such a way that it caused a severe personal rift
between them.[^fn:4]

The central (and interrelated) elements of Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy of nature that are
relevant for his break with Fichte and development of his &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; idealism are:

1.  The productivity of nature
2.  The distinction between nature as being and nature as product
3.  The conception of self-consciousness as merely the highest form or expression of
    the productive forces of nature
4.  Nature as the &ldquo;indifference&rdquo; or basis of subject-object duality; otherwise
    expressed as the &ldquo;absolute identity&rdquo; of subject and object in nature
5.  Intellectual intuition as the non-discursive act of grasping the absolute (or the
    identity/indifference of subject and object)

These last two points only become fully explicit with Schelling&rsquo;s full break, in the
_Presentation of My System_, from Fichte&rsquo;s position. I&rsquo;ll accordingly discuss (1)-(3)
here and (4)-(5) in a separate set of notes.


### <span class="section-num">4.1</span> The Productivity of Nature {#the-productivity-of-nature}

Recall that Kant argued for a conception of nature as the result of a &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;
causation wherein material parts, occupying space in virtue a balance of the
fundamental forces of attraction and repulsion, efficiently cause the wholes of which
they are members. Kant recognizes that this conception of material nature is
inadequate for certain types of beings---viz. organisms whose powers contradict
mechanical efficient causality, since they are both the cause and effect of
themselves (via reproduction, self-organization, and the reciprocal dependence of
their parts). Kant argued that these features can only be explained by positing a
&ldquo;formative power&rdquo; in the organism, which is in opposition to the merely motive or
mechanical powers of non-organic matter.

Schelling considers Kant&rsquo;s conception of an opposition in nature between motive and
productive forces an objectionable dualism that cannot be sustained. It encourages a
conception of organisms as &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;, standing in opposition to material
nature. Schelling&rsquo;s crucial move is to reject this opposition in favor of positing
productive forces as a constitutive part of nature itself. This position is a
departure not only from Kant, but also from Fichte, in that it no longer sees nature
as something to be derived from the subject or absolute &rsquo;I&rsquo; of Fichte&rsquo;s
transcendental philosophy. Instead, Schelling here inverts the Fichtean (and
implicitly the Kantian) position to derive the self-conscious subject from the
ultimate or most complex of the productive forces posited in nature. In Kantian terms
Schelling makes the teleological causation characteristic of organisms into a
constitutive rather than a merely regulative law.

> [The] tendency [of Fichte&rsquo;s philosophy] will be to bring back everywhere the real
> to the ideal---a process which gives rise to what is called transcendental
> philosophy. The regularity displayed in all the movements of Nature---for example,
> the sublime geometry which is exercised in the motions of the heavenly bodies---is
> not explained by saying that Nature is the most perfect geometry. Rather
> conversely, it is explained by saying that the most perfect geometry is the
> productive power in Nature; a mode of explanation whereby the real itself is
> transported into the ideal world, and those motions are changed into intuitions
> which take place only in ourselves, and to which nothing outside of us corresponds.
> ... [in contrast] all of this [order in nature] is explained in our view by saying
> that it [viz. organization] is an unconscious productivity in its origin akin to
> the conscious, whose mere reflection we see in Nature, and which from the
> standpoint of the natural view must appear as one and the same blind drive that
> exerts its influence from crystallization upward to the highest point of organic
> formation (in which, on one side, through the technical drive, it returns again to
> mere crystallization) only acting on different planes. (7:271-2)

Schelling construes the transcendental philosophy of Kant and Fichte, not unfairly,
as explaining order and organization in nature in terms of the constitutive and
projective acts of the rational mind as such. Thus, to speak in Fichte&rsquo;s terms,
though all our knowledge ultimately adverts to experience, in which subject and
object are in opposition, according to Fichte it is the self-conscious subject that
is the ultimately privileged explanatory basis of everything that can be known (i.e.
anything that could be a &ldquo;science&rdquo; in the sense at issue for the _Wissenschaftslehre_).
Here we see Schelling rejecting this position. As he puts things more pithily
a few sentences later, &ldquo;the ideal must arise out of the real and admit of explanation
from it&rdquo; (7:272).

However, Schelling does not yet seem to want to quite reject the position of the
_Wissenshaftslehre_, instead he expresses the view that _Naturphilosophie_ is
explanatorily on par with the WL.

> if it is the task of transcendental philosophy to subordinate the real to the
> ideal, it is, on the other hand, the task of the philosophy of nature to explain
> the ideal by the real. The two sciences are therefore but one science,
> differentiated only in the opposite orientation of their tasks. Moreover, as the
> two directions are not only equally possible, but equally necessary, the same
> necessity attaches to both in the system of knowledge. (7:272-3)


### <span class="section-num">4.2</span> Natura naturans, Natura naturata {#natura-naturans-natura-naturata}

Schelling&rsquo;s conception of &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; distinguishes two distinct aspects, which he
borrows from Spinoza. These are Nature as _productive_ and Nature as _product_. In
Spinoza&rsquo;s terms, it is a distinction between _Natura naturans_ and _Natura naturata_.
Spinoza discusses this distinction most explicitly in two places. The first is from
his _Short Treatise_, which is a kind of non-geometrical exposition of the position
elaborated in his _Ethics_:

> Here, before we proceed to anything else, we shall briefly divide the whole of
> Nature into _Natura naturans_ and _Natura naturata_. By _Natura naturans_ we understand a
> being that we conceive clearly and distinctly through itself, without needing
> anything other than itself (like all the attributes which we have so far
> described), that is, God. The Thomists have also understood God by this phrase, but
> their _Natura naturans_ was a being (as they called it) beyond all substances.
>
> ... Turning now to universal _Natura naturata_, or those modes or creatures which
> immediately depend on, or have been created by God---we know only two of these:
> motion in matter, and intellect in the thinking thing. We say, then, that these
> have been from all eternity, and will remain to all eternity, immutable, a work
> truly as great as the greatness of the workman (1:47-8).

Spinoza articulates the distinction in a similar, if slightly condensed, way in the _Ethics_:

> (E1P29S): Before I proceed further, I wish to explain here---or rather to advise [the
> reader]---what we must understand by _Natura naturans_ and _Natura naturata_. For from
> the preceding I think it is already established that by _Natura naturans_ we must
> understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, or such attributes of
> substance as express an eternal and infinite essence, that is (by P14Cl and P17C2),
> God, insofar as he is considered as a free cause. But by _Natura naturata_ I
> understand whatever follows from the necessity of God&rsquo;s nature, or from any of
> God&rsquo;s attributes, that is, all the modes of God&rsquo;s attributes insofar as they are
> considered as things which are in God, and can neither be nor be conceived without
> God. (2:71)

Schelling makes several allusions to Spinoza&rsquo;s position in the _Introduction_, but the
clearest is from part II of section 6:

> As long as we only know the totality of objects as the sum total of all being, this
> totality is a mere _world_, that is, a mere product for us. It would certainly be
> impossible in the science of nature to rise to a higher idea than that of being if
> all permanence (which is thought in the idea of being) were not deceptive, and
> really a continuous and uniform reproduction.
>
> Insofar as we regard the totality of objects not merely as a product, but at the
> same time necessarily as productive, it becomes _Nature_ for us, and this _identity of
> the product and the productivity_, and this alone, is implied by the idea of Nature,
> even in the ordinary use of language. _Nature_ as a mere _product_ (_natura naturata_) we
> call Nature as _object_ (with this alone all empiricism deals). _Nature as
> productivity_ (_natura naturans_) we call _Nature as subject_ (with this alone all
> theory deals). (7:284)

In drawing on Spinoza, Schelling aims to make at least the following points:

1.  &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; refers not just to the sum total of all (possible) empirical objects
    (i.e. a &ldquo;world&rdquo;), but also the ground of those beings.
2.  The concept `<Nature>` marks an &ldquo;ontological difference&rdquo; (as Heidegger will
    ultimately call it) between particular beings and _Being_ as that through which they
    are what they are.
3.  _Empirical_ science deals only with nature as product or object (i.e. _Natura
    naturata_) while _Naturphilosophie_ or speculative physics considers, as well, Nature
    as productivity or subject (i.e. _Natura naturans_).

Thus by construing Nature as intrinsically productive Schelling avoids the antinomy
to which Kant construed reason as subject. But Schelling also effectively embraces a
quasi-pansychist position in doing so. The advantage of this position is that it
allows for the adoption of a genuine form of realism concerning things apart from the
human mind. But it does so at the potential cost of introducing mindedness (at least
in its most primitive form) into the world itself, in the form of an unconscious
drive in nature to organic production.


### <span class="section-num">4.3</span> Nature & Self-Consciousness {#nature-and-self-consciousness}

Fichte argues that idealism and dogmatism are opposed and that dogmatism fails to
adequately explain both the possibility and nature of self-consciousness. Schelling&rsquo;s
philosophy of nature seeks to explain the self-conscious subject through objective
nature. Isn&rsquo;t this a form of dogmatism?

Schelling was well aware of Fichte&rsquo;s juxtaposition of the dogmatism and idealism (for
Schelling it is dogmatism and criticism). He construes his philosophy of nature as
avoiding dogmatism because it allows for both efficient and final causation in nature
and construes the formative drive in nature as manifesting in ever more complex ways,
the most complex or &ldquo;highest&rdquo; of which is the self-conscious rational subject. Hence,
while Schelling starts from what might be construed as the &ldquo;object pole&rdquo; of
experience, his position is not dogmatism in Fichte&rsquo;s sense. Moreover, since
Schelling construes Nature as _both_ subject and object, the philosophy of nature is
better construed as deriving _both_ from itself rather than favoring one over the
other. This &ldquo;indifference&rdquo; of subject and object becomes explicit in Schelling&rsquo;s
philosophy of identity, which is first publicized in his _Presentation of My System
of Philosophy_ in 1801.
