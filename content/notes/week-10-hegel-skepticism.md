## <span class="section-num">1</span> Who is Hegel? {#who-is-hegel}

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) is the last of the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; German
Idealists, and the most systematic thinker of any of the post-Kantians. Hegel
attempts to articulate a fully comprehensive system of philosophy, including logic,
metaphysics, aesthetics, social and political, and natural philosophy, all from one
basic and presuppositionless starting point.

Hegel&rsquo;s early work is significantly influenced by Schelling&rsquo;s _Naturphilosophie_ and
his system of absolute idealism. The two worked closely together in Jena. In 1801
Hegel wrote _The Difference between Fichte’s and Schelling’s System of Philosophy_,
which argued that Schelling&rsquo;s system of transcendental idealism succeeds where
Fichte&rsquo;s (and Reinhold&rsquo;s) systems fail. They also edited an influential, if
short-lived, _Critical Journal of Philosophy_, where Hegel published some important
early essays, including his &ldquo;On the Relationship of Skepticism to Philosophy&rdquo;.
Schelling left Jena in 1803, and their friendship was at an end by the time of the
publication of the _Phenomenology_, perhaps in no small part due to criticisms Hegel
there seemingly aims at Schelling&rsquo;s system.

Hegel’s published corpus consists of several different types of work. First, there
are Hegel’s two major books: the _Phenomenology of Spirit_ (1807) and _Science of Logic_
(1812–18). Second are works that were published at the time as handbooks for use in
student teaching such as the Encyclopaedia of Philosophical _Sciences_ and /Elements of
the Philosophy of Right. Third, there are posthumous publications, assembled by
editors from Hegel&rsquo;s lecture notes and from student transcripts of the lectures as
delivered. Finally, there are the various essays and short works published during his
career.

While Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy has been enormously influential, it has also been the
subject of much criticism and controversy. Recent scholarly debates have centered on
the issue of whether Hegel&rsquo;s metaphysics is &ldquo;pre-critical&rdquo;, whether it is really even
_metaphysics_, and whether or how he should be read as advancing Kant&rsquo;s critical
philosophy.[^fn:1]


## <span class="section-num">2</span> Forms of Skepticism {#forms-of-skepticism}

Hegel distinguishes between different forms of sckepticsm in his 1801 essay &ldquo;On the
Relationship of Skepticism to Philosophy&rdquo;. There is the skepticism that is &ldquo;one with
philosophy&rdquo; and then the skepticism that is &ldquo;self-sundered from it&rdquo; (BKH p. 330; cf.
322-3).

The primary difference between forms of skepticism that Hegel alludes to here is that
between a presuppositionless and methodical skepticism and a skepticism that arises
due to inconsistencies between some presupposed claim and some other set of claims.
Hegel contends that the former sort of skepticism is characteristic of ancient
skepticism, while the latter is more distinctively modern.

[Ancient skepticism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-ancient) (as, e.g., in Sextus Empiricus, Pyrrho, or Agrippa) had both a
distinctive method, and because of that method, a kind of presuppositionlessness. The
method was, fundamentally, the presentation of rationally opposing positions whose
evidence was equal. This &ldquo;equipollence&rdquo; of reasons then leads to the suspension of
judgment or belief as to the what is the case. Thus ancient skepticism, as Hegel sees
it, does not arrive at a skeptical conclusion or aporia based on commitment to a
prior view of what is true. Instead, it conducts its skeptical investigation entirely
through the opposition of grounds for and against a claim.

In contrast to ancient skepticism, Hegel construes modern forms of skepticism to be
dogmatically committed to one or more presusppositions that render subsequent
philosophical inquiry impossible. In Schulze&rsquo;s case it is an unquestioning commitment
to experience. As Hegel puts it,

> Mr. Sch[ulze] himself allows the objection to be made against this concept of
> skepticism, that according to it &ldquo;_nothing_ of what _experience teaches_, can be an
> _object of skeptical_ doubt, and in particular _not the sum-total_ [_Inbegriff_] _of
> external perceptions_, and _only philosophy among all the sciences_ (since none of the
> others has to do with the cognition of things outside the compass of
> consciousness)&rdquo; (BKH p. 320)

Hegel&rsquo;s contention that modern skepticism is _essentially_ dogmatic also relates to his
view that it is _degenerate_ and lacks any method.

> To be sure, the authentic skepticism does not have a positive side, as philosophy
> does, but maintains a pure negativity in relation to knowledge, but it was just as
> little directed against philosophy as for it; and the hostile attitude that it
> adopted later against philosophy on the one hand, and against dogmatism on the
> other hand, is quite separate. The turning of skepticism against philosophy, as
> soon as philosophy became dogmatism, illustrates how it has kept in step with the
> communal degeneration of philosophy and of the world in general, until finally in
> these most recent times it has sunk so far in company with dogmatism that for both
> of them nowadays the facts of consciousness have an indubitable certainty, and
> for them both the truth resides in temporality; so that, since the extremes now
> touch, the great goal is attained once more on their side in these happy times,
> that dogmatism and skepticism coincide with one another on the underside, and offer
> each other the hand of perfect friendship and fraternity. (BKH p. 330)

The &ldquo;degeneration&rdquo; of which Hegel speaks here is the positing of oppositions that
cannot be overcome without giving up framing presuppositions of the skeptical or
philosophical view. Such framing oppositions include mind vs. body,
representation/cognition vs. world, or self-knowledge vs. knowledge of the &ldquo;external&rdquo;
world. These sorts of oppositions are not motivated by any equipollence of reasons,
as with Ancient skepticism. Instead, in each case the skepticism is motivated by what
Hegel sees as dogmatic commitment to the problem-inducing opposition. In this sense
&ldquo;philosophy has become dogmatism&rdquo; and &ldquo;dogmatism and skepticism coincide with one
another&rdquo;.[^fn:2]


## <span class="section-num">3</span> The Problem of the Criterion {#the-problem-of-the-criterion}

In keeping with the privileged position Hegel accords to ancient skepticism, the
Introduction to the _Phenomenology of Spirit_ emphasizes the way in which different
putatively rational sciences might conflict and inquires into how these conflicts
might be resolved.

> with regard to a knowing that is not truthful, science cannot simply reject it as
> just a common view of things while giving out the assurance that it is itself a
> completely different kind of cognition and that that other knowing counts as
> absolutely nothing for science; nor can science appeal to some intimation,
> contained within that other knowing, of something better. Through such an
> _assurance_, science declares its being to be its power; but untrue knowing just as
> much appeals to the fact that _it is_, and it _gives out the assurance_ that science
> counts as nothing to it; but _one_ arid assurance is just as valid as another. (PS
> 2:55, §76)

The problem to which Hegel is pointing here is known as the &ldquo;problem of the
criterion&rdquo;, and is discussed by Sextus Empiricus in his _Outlines of Skepticism_. There
he says,

> in order for the dispute that has arisen about standards to be decided, we must
> possess an agreed standard through which we can judge it; and in order for us to
> possess an agreed standard, the dispute about standards must already have been
> decided. Thus the argument falls into the reciprocal mode [i.e. circular reasoning]
> and the discovery of a standard is blocked - for we do not allow them to assume a
> standard by hypothesis, and if they want to judge the standard by a standard we
> throw them into an infinite regress. Again, since a proof needs a standard which
> has been proved and a standard needs a proof which has been judged, they are thrown
> into the reciprocal mode.[^fn:3]

Sextus here points to a basic epistemological problem. When we engage in rational
dispute concerning what to believe, we assume a common conception between disputants
concerning the marks (or criteria) of truth. But what do we do when these marks
themselves are disputed? It looks like there are only three possible answers:[^fn:4]
first, we can simply assume or posit that the criterion is what it is (i.e. is
brute); second, we can appeal to some further criterion, and so on ad inifinitum;
third, we can say that the criterion is self-certifying (i.e. it cannot be
demonstrated without circularity). The problem is that none of these options seems
satisfying. The appeal to bruteness is irrational---the skeptic rejects that a
standard may simply be assumed. The infinite regress of criteria is likewise
unsatisfying, though explaining exactly why is worth pursuing. Finally, the skeptic
denies that a rationally satisfying reply is available via proof, for proof itself
involves the assumption of a standard, which, if it relies on some other proof, falls
back into circularity. This is perhaps the most controversial of the skeptic&rsquo;s moves,
for it seems to assume that there are no genuinely self-evident or self-certifying
rational claims.

This problem is faced by the two major approaches to justification and knowledge in
epistemology---viz. coherentism and foundationalism. Against coherentism, Sextus
raises the twin charges of circularity and infinite regress. The worry here is that a
principled coherentist position cannot exhibit the difference between a genuine
change in what we know---i.e. in the progressive accumulation of knowledge---and mere
change in (coherent) belief.[^fn:5] Against foundationalism, the argument raises
similar worries concerning circularity, along with the additional charge of
dogmatism, so long as one or another &ldquo;foundational&rdquo; claim is simply assumed or
posited.

One of Hegel&rsquo;s primary concerns in the _Phenomenology_ is to show how the trilemma may
be avoided without also falling into any of the skeptical tropes characteristic of
modern philosophy. In this sense the PS is a work of epistemology (though it is
certainly not _only_ a work in epistemology). Hegel explicitly references this problem
as follows:

> This exposition, represented as the _conduct_ of _science_ in relation to knowing _as it
> appears_, and represented as the _investigation_ and _testing of the reality_ of
> _cognition_, seems incapable of taking place without some kind of presupposition
> which underlies it as a _standard_. For the testing consists in the application of an
> accepted standard, and in the resulting equality or inequality between the standard
> and what is tested lays the decision as to whether what is tested is correct or
> incorrect. The standard, likewise science itself if science were to be the
> standard, is thereby accepted as the _essence_, or as the _in-itself_. But here, at the
> point where science first comes on the scene, neither science itself nor anything
> else has justified itself as the essence or as the in-itself, and without something
> like that taking place, it seems that no examination can take place at all. (PS
> 2:58, §81)

What then, is Hegel&rsquo;s solution? Hegel sets out an answer in the rest of the
introduction (§§82-9). The crux of his solution, in its broadest outlines, is to
treat skepticism, and the problem of the criterion in particular, as an issue that is
immanent to consciousness, in that it is present in any structure of representation
where there is an opposition between subject and object. As Hegel puts it,
&ldquo;Consciousness in its own self provides its own standard&rdquo; (PS 2:59, §84). As he goes
on to say,

> in what consciousness declares within itself to be the _in-itself_, or the _true_, we
> have the standard which consciousness itself sets up to measure its knowing. If we
> designate _knowing_ as the _concept_, but designate the essence, or the _true_, as what
> is or the _object_, then the examining consists in seeing whether the concept
> corresponds to the object. However, if we designate the _essence_, or the in-itself
> _of the object, as the concept_, and in contrast understand by _object_ the concept
> insofar as it is _object_, or insofar as it is _for an other_, then the examining
> consists in our seeing whether the object corresponds to its concept. (PS 2:59, §84)

Any knowledge claim is going to be one according to which a subject knows (or claims
to) something _of_ an object. But knowledge of the object is conceived as of a _being
as it is in itself_, which is to say, of a being as it is independently of whether it
is known or not. In this sense the object is the standard against which knowledge of
it is to be measured. We can say something similar about the concept. So there is a
kind of duality in the investigation of knowledge, whereby both the concept being
employed in the knowledge claim, as well as the object being investigated, have a
related structure.[^fn:6]

Hegel&rsquo;s view of the structure of knowledge in terms of a subject-object duality is
related to several further significant claims. First, he contends that the structure
of &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; consciousness is _dialectical_, in the sense that it is
essentially unstable, containing within itself a kind of &ldquo;contradiction&rdquo; that needs
to be &ldquo;sublated&rdquo; or nullified (_aufgehoben_). However the instability that Hegel
contends in present in natural consciousness is not inherently destructive. It is a
kind of _constructive_ skepticism (it is in this sense that, as Hegel puts it in his
skepticism essay, skepticism is &ldquo;one with philosophy&rdquo; (BKH p. 330)). Hegel says,

> the exposition of non-truthful consciousness in its untruth is not a merely
> _negative_ movement. Such a one-sided view is what natural consciousness generally
> has of it; and a knowing which makes this one-sidedness into its essence is one of
> the shapes of incomplete consciousness which lies within the course of the path
> itself and which will serve itself up in that path. That is, such a one-sided view
> is the skepticism which sees in the result always only _pure nothing_ and which
> abstracts from the fact that this nothing is determinately the nothing _of that from
> which it results_. However, only when taken as the nothing of that from which it
> emerges is the nothing in fact the true result; thus it is itself a _determinate_
> nothing and it has a _content_. Skepticism which ends with the abstraction of
> nothingness or emptiness cannot progress any further from this point, but must
> instead wait to see whether something new will present itself and what it will be,
> in order that it can also toss it into the same empty abyss. By contrast, while the
> result is grasped as it is in truth, as _determinate_ negation, a new form has
> thereby immediately arisen, and in the negation, the transition is made whereby the
> progression through the complete series of shapes comes about on its own accord.
> (PS 2:57, §79)

Thus the instability of natural consciousness generates a new form of consciousness
through a &ldquo;determination negation&rdquo; of the previous assumption of the subject-object
relation. This leads to Hegel&rsquo;s second major contention, that this dialectical
process leads to a _succession_ of different &ldquo;forms&rdquo; or &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; (_Gestalten_) of

Third, Hegel contends that this succession of shapes of consciousness has an end or
terminus in &ldquo;absolute knowing&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Phenomenology of Spirit&rdquo; is thus the story of
the various shapes consciousness takes on the path to absolute knowledge, which Hegel
considers the starting point for his scientific system---beginning with the _Science
of Logic_. In this sense, Hegel&rsquo;s original title for the book is perhaps more apt, as
a &ldquo;science of the experience of consciousness&rdquo;. Hegel characterizes the development
of consciousness as following a kind of path (or making a journey), in a sense
related to Dante&rsquo;s allegory of the soul&rsquo;s journey into despair and ultimately to
salvation. Hegel puts it this way in the Introduction:

> Natural consciousness will prove to be only the concept of knowing, or it will
> prove to be not real knowing. But while it immediately regards itself rather as
> real knowing, this path has negative meaning for it, and what is the realization of
> the concept will count instead, to it, as the loss of itself, for on this path, it
> loses its truth. This path can accordingly be regarded as the path of _doubt_, or,
> more properly, as the path of despair; on this path, what happens is not what is
> customarily understood as doubt, a shaking of this or that supposed truth, followed
> by the disappearance again of the doubt, and then a return to the former truth so
> that in the end the thing at issue is taken as it was before. Rather, this path is
> the conscious insight into the untruth of knowing as it appears, a knowing for
> which that which is the most real is rather in truth only the unrealized concept.
> ... The series of the figurations of consciousness which consciousness traverses on
> this path is the full history of the _cultivation_ of consciousness itself into
> science. (PS 2:56, §78)

Hegel thus presents a method for moving from one conception of knowledge to another
via the dialectic present within each conception, until one arrives at a stable
point, which he contends is that of absolute knowing. In this sense Hegel agrees with
Schelling that the aim of philosophy is articulating the absolute, i.e. the
indifference point between subject and object. But Hegel importantly rejects
Schelling&rsquo;s starting point. Hegel&rsquo;s sytem,

> is something very different from the inspiration which begins immediately, like a
> shot from a pistol, with absolute knowledge, and which has already finished with
> all the other standpoints simply by declaring that it will take no notice of them.
> (PS 2:24, §27)

Natural consciousness must follow the &ldquo;path of despair&rdquo; through the various
dialectical forms of consciousness until stability (in absolute knowing) is achieved,
rather than arriving there as if &ldquo;shot from a pistol&rdquo;.

As we will see, Hegel is keen to articulate a philosophical system that is immune to various skeptical worries and methods.
