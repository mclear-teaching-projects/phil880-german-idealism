One of the more remarkable features of German Idealism is its insistence that
science must be _systematic_. Why is this? Here I discuss the idea of
systematicity primarily as it appears in Kant and Hegel.[^fn:1]

## <span class="section-num">1</span> Proper Science {#proper-science}

The systematicity of German Idealism stems in large part from its roots
in Greek antiquity&rsquo;s conception of a &ldquo;proper science&rdquo; (_haplos_
\\(epist\bar{e}m\bar{e}\\); _scientia propter quid_; _eigentliche
Wissenschaft_). This notion of a &ldquo;science&rdquo; or &ldquo;scientia&rdquo; is often
translated with the English term &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; but it is not a term that
obviously tracks the work &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; in its contemporary English sense.
Occasionally _\\(epist\bar{e}m\bar{e}\\)_ is translated as &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;.
This is perhaps more felicitous, since unlike isolated knowledge, a
systemic knowing of things is perhaps more akin to our notion of
&ldquo;comprehension&rdquo; or &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;.

The conception of science as &ldquo;properly&rdquo; understood is very demanding. It
is perhaps best to think of it as a kind of epistemic _ideal_. Robert
Pasnau, puts the Greek position as exemplified by Aristotle this way:

> what is most distinctive about Aristotle&rsquo;s conception of
> _\\(epist\bar{e}m\bar{e}\\)_ is his insistence that it involve a grasp not
> just of a single isolated proposition, but of the whole causal and
> inferential network of propositions that lie behind it...what he tells
> us here is that it is easy to make a contribution to
> _\\(epist\bar{e}m\bar{e}\\)_, but very hard to achieve the complete ideal.
> (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_11">Pasnau 2014, 994–95</a>)

So an articulation of a science, properly so called, is going to require
knowledge, not just of single truths or propositions, but of a series of
_connected_ propositions. Moreover, such connection aims to secure two
goals. The first is that all known truths are compatible with one
another. There is no scientific knowledge that is incompatible with
other such knowledge. Second, that scientific knowledge is _derived_ from
other knowledge within the science (or system). This fits with
Aristotle&rsquo;s characterization of a proper science as one that gives
understanding of a truth through its ground.

> We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing,
> as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows,
> when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause
> of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact could not be other
> than it is....The proper object of unqualified scientific knowledge is
> something which cannot be other than it is. (Aristotle, _Posterior Analytics_,
> I.2, 71b; (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Aristotle 1993, 2</a>))

This derivational constraint sets out two further characteristics of
proper science, viz. that it is demonstrative, and that each part is
apodictically certain, in virtue of its relation to its ground(s).

More generally, we can set out the characteristics of proper science as
follows:

First, proper science is _demonstrative_ (i.e. involving demonstration or
&ldquo;_apodeixis_&rdquo;), in that it is (a) articulable in logical (syllogistic)
form and (b) generates conclusions that &ldquo;follow from&rdquo; their premises (or
are derived from them with necessity). Second, knowledge in a proper
science is apodictically certain, in that it is impossible for the
conclusion of any demonstrative element of the science to be false while
its premises are true. Moreover, every premise in a demonstratively
known judgment of proper science is itself either part of a
demonstration, or known from itself.[^fn:2] Third, such scientific
knowledge is _explanatory_, in the sense that (i) each known proposition
is the conclusion of a demonstration that thereby provides knowledge
why, not merely knowledge that; (ii) there is an asymmetric dependence
relation between premises and conclusion, such that the order of the
premises displays their (metaphysical) priority with respect to the
conclusion; (iii) the fact indicated in conclusion is _caused_ by the
facts indicated in the premises, such that the conclusion is known to
hold through its _sufficient metaphysical ground_.

Spinoza gives a nice articulation of these conditions, which he puts in
terms of coming to have the (real or metaphysical) _definition_ of a
thing:[^fn:3]

> If the thing be a created thing, the definition, as we have said, must
> include its proximate cause. For example, according to this rule a
> circle would have to be defined as follows: a figure described by any
> line of which one end is fixed and the other movable. This definition
> clearly includes the proximate cause. The conception or definition of
> the thing must be such that all the properties of the thing, when
> regarded by itself and not in conjunction with other things, can be
> deduced from it, as can be seen in the case of this definition of a
> circle. For from it we clearly deduce that all the lines drawn from
> the centre to the circumference are equal. (Spinoza, _Treatise on the
> Emendation of the Intellect_, 96)


## <span class="section-num">2</span> Kant on the Systematicity of Science {#kant-on-the-systematicity-of-science}


### <span class="section-num">2.1</span> Kant on Proper Science {#kant-on-proper-science}

For Kant, the term &ldquo;science&rdquo; (_Wissenschaft_; _scientia_) always denotes a
systematically organized body of cognitions. As he puts it,

> Every doctrine that is supposed to be a system, that is, a whole of
> cognition ordered according to principles, is called a science. (MFNS:
> 4:467)

But not all science is &ldquo;properly so-called&rdquo;. This means that there are some
sciences in name only, while other (e.g. physics) are genuine or &ldquo;proper&rdquo;
(_eigentlich_) sciences. What is a proper science (_eigentliche Wissenschaft_)? It
is a systematically ordered body of cognitions ordered by a principle or set
of principles that:

1.  organize the subject matter of the science as a whole and delineate
    it from other subject matter
2.  ground with &rsquo;apodeictic&rsquo; certainty the various cognitions that
    constitute the subject matter of the science
3.  ground/explain the universal reach and necessary application of
    claims made by the science

Here&rsquo;s Kant again:

> What can be called proper science is only that whose certainty is apodictic;
> cognition that can contain mere empirical certainty is only knowledge
> improperly so-called....natural science must derive the legitimacy of this
> title only from its pure part -- namely, that which contains the a priori
> principles of all other natural explanations -- and [that is] why only in
> virtue of this pure part is natural science to be proper science. (MFNS
> 4:468-9)

To say that the certainty of knowledge in proper science is &ldquo;apodictic&rdquo; is to
say that it is not only necessary, but that it is known to be so _from its
ground(s)_. For Kant, this means that it is a proposition whose truth is
judged/asserted as the outcome of an inference, the premises of which
articulate grounds sufficient for the truth of the conclusion. In this sense
even contingent empirical truths may be known apodictically, since such truths
are the outcome of sufficient determining grounds.


### <span class="section-num">2.2</span> Kant&rsquo;s Architectonic {#kant-and-rsquo-s-architectonic}

Kant defines &ldquo;architectonic&rdquo; as the &ldquo;art of systems&rdquo;. He contends that
systematicity---i.e. systematic unity---is &ldquo;that which first makes ordinary
cognition into science, i.e., makes a system out of a mere aggregate of it&rdquo;
thus &ldquo;architectonic is the doctrine of that which is scientific in our
cognition in general&rdquo; (A832/B860).

Given Kant&rsquo;s conception of a proper science, we can see why he would thus
demand systematicity in the structure of our cognition if it is to be
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo;. Kant explains his position further by relating the conception of
science as systematic to that of having an &ldquo;idea&rdquo; of the unity of a plurality
(or &ldquo;manifold&rdquo;) of cognitions.

> I understand by a system, however, the unity of the manifold cognitions
> under one idea. This is the rational concept of the form of a whole, insofar
> as through this the domain of the manifold as well as the position of the
> parts with respect to each other is determined a priori. The scientific
> rational concept thus contains the end and the form of the whole that is
> congruent with it. (A832/B860)

So all science is based on an &ldquo;idea&rdquo;---i.e. a concept of reason---that
organizes all of elements of the science as subject. He says, &ldquo;Nobody attempts
to establish a science without grounding it on an idea&rdquo; (A834/B862). The idea
thus _delimits_ or _demarcates_ the science from other sciences (as well as any
mere aggregate of cognition). It also, in so delimiting the science, is the
basis through which each cognition is connected (in ground-consequent
relations). Thus all of the parts of the science are comprehended through its
idea.

Moreover, Kant characterizes this in terms of meeting the ends or needs of
reason. He says,

> Under the government of reason our cognitions cannot at all constitute a
> rhapsody but must constitute a system, in which alone they can support and
> advance its essential ends. (A832/B860)

So part of the systematicity of science is that it serves the &ldquo;essential ends&rdquo;
of reason. What are the ends of reason as Kant sees them? Kant says that
reason has as its necessary end the sytematic unity of cognition.

> For the law of reason to seek unity is necessary, since without it we
> would have no reason and without that, no coherent use of the
> understanding, and, lacking that, no sufficient mark of empirical
> truth (A651/B679)

More generally, we can say that reason seeks the comprehension of all
cognitions under apodictic principles. Part of the functional differentiation
of the mind&rsquo;s various capacities requires specifying particular ends
determined by the fundamental aims of those capacities in their speculative
and practical use---viz. achieving cognition, and ultimately what Kant calls
&ldquo;comprehension&rdquo; (_Begreifen_), via a priori principles (JL 9:64-5; see also
_Dohna-Wundlacken Logik_ 24:730-1 (c. 1792); _Wiener Logik_ 24:846 (1780);
_Blomberg Logik_ 24:132-3, 134-5, 136 (c. 1771)).

So science requires systematicity in part because of the nature of reason
itself (viz. its end of comprehending), on which the drive to systematicity
and the generation of organizing ideas depends.

A further implication of construing the cognitions of a proper science as
comprehended through their idea, is that the subject matter of the science
must exhibit a hierarchical explanatory structure, in the sense that there is
a fundamental set of characteristics that our knowledge aims at -- the
&ldquo;essence&rdquo; or &ldquo;nature&rdquo; of a thing. These characteristics determine what other
properties are possible for the thing. So if we know a thing&rsquo;s essence, we can
know its other properties from their grounds (i.e. from the essence as the
(partly) sufficient causal basis). Hence, on Kant&rsquo;s view we have scientific
knowledge when we know something&rsquo;s real essence and understand the connections
between the essence and other properties of a thing, as in (e.g.) geometric
deduction -- where we might know the properties of a circle from the circle&rsquo;s
definition as a line whose every point is equidistant from an arbitrary
&ldquo;center&rdquo; point.

Kant contends that pre-critical metaphysics cannot provide a merely empirical
explanation of how we could have knowledge of this hierarchy of properties. On
such views, there is no explanation of how we could know substance as
substrate---i.e. as that being whose essence determines its various
experiencable properties. Certainly, Newton and Locke were in agreement with
Kant on this:

> we certainly do not know what is the substance of any thing. We see only the
> shapes and colors of bodies, we hear only their sounds, we touch only their
> external surfaces, we smell only their odors, and we taste their flavors.
> But there is no direct sense and there are no indirect reflected actions by
> which we know innermost substances (Newton (2004), 91; cf. Locke, E
> IV.iii.14, 546)

Since Kant _does_ contend that we can know the essence of things, as least
_insofar as they could be objects of experience_, a science of such things will
take the form of elucidating these essences. But Kant also thinks that we can
only know the essences of objects of experience because we (i.e. our minds)
are the basis or condition of such knowledge. Hence, a characterization of
the structure and systematicity of science is simply a reflection of the
structure and system inherent in the finite discursive mind. Let&rsquo;s look at
this in a bit more detail.


### <span class="section-num">2.3</span> Kant&rsquo;s Science of Nature -- General vs. Special Metaphysics {#kant-and-rsquo-s-science-of-nature-general-vs-dot-special-metaphysics}

It is part of the contention of the Critical philosophy that a science is only
possible in so far as it is based on the conditions of synthetic a priori
cognition. Kant argues that the structure of the finite discursive mind sets
those conditions. Thus the only proper science is that of the objects of
experience---or often simply &ldquo;nature&rdquo;, whose synthetic a priori conditions may
be cognized and ultimately known.

Here&rsquo;s how Kant puts things in the Architectonic of the first _Critique_:

> Metaphysics in the narrower sense consists of _transcendental philosophy_ and the _physiology_ of pure reason. The former considers only the _understanding_ and reason itself in a system of concepts and principles that relate to objects in general, without assuming objects that may be _given_ (Ontologia). The latter considers _nature_ – i.e., the totality of _given_ objects . . . and is therefore _physiology_ (although only rationalis)” (A845/B873).

Kant then explains that the latter doctrine (rational physiology) consists in
turn of a “metaphysics of corporeal nature” or “rational physics,” and a
“metaphysics of thinking nature” or “rational psychology” (A846/B874). Kant&rsquo;s
explanation of why things are split up this way immediately adverts to his
conception of the possibility of metaphysics as grounded in the structure of
finite discursive cognition. He says,

> how can I expect an a priori cognition, and thus a metaphysics, of objects insofar as they are given to our senses, and therefore given a posteriori? . . . The answer is: we take no more from experience than what is necessary to _give_ us an object – of either outer or inner sense. The former takes place through the mere concept of matter (impenetrable, lifeless extension), the latter through the concept of a thinking being (in the empirical inner representation: I think)” (A847-8/B875-6)

Kant is also clear about this in his later (1785) work _Metaphysical
Foundations of Natural Science_. In this work, we again see Kant as
distinguishing between transcendental philosophy (i.e. &ldquo;critique&rdquo;, or the
doctrine through which the possibility of metaphysics is articulated), and a
metaphysics of nature, which &ldquo;considers everything so far as it is, on the
basis of a priori concepts&rdquo; (A845/B873). This latter has two parts:

> [A metaphysics of nature] must always contain solely principles that are not
> empirical (for precisely this reason it bears the name of a metaphysics), but
> it can still either: first, treat the laws that make possible the concept of a
> nature in general...in which case it is the transcendental part of the
> metaphysics of nature; or second, concern itself with a particular nature of
> this or that kind of thing, for which an empirical concept is given, and here
> such a science must still always be called a metaphysics of nature, namely, of
> corporeal or of thinking nature. [In this second case] it is then not a
> general, but a special metaphysical natural science (physics or psychology),
> in which the above transcendental principles are applied to the two species of
> objects of our senses. (MFNS 4:469-70; cf. A845-9/B873-7)

So we have:

1.  General metaphysics
    -   conditions of an object in general
2.  Special metaphysics
    -   Corporeal nature (physics)
        -   conditions of material objects
    -   Thinking nature (psychology)
        -   conditions of mental objects

General (or Transcendental) metaphysics concerns nature in its \`material&rsquo;
sense, as the sum total of all appearances which stand in lawful connection to
one another, in virtue of the principles derived from the activity of the
categories of understanding and the forms of sensibility in organizing
experience.

> all appearances of nature, as far as their combination is concerned, stand
> under the categories, on which nature (considered merely as nature in general)
> depends, as the original ground of its necessary lawfulness (as _natura
> formaliter spectata_). (B165; cf. B159-60, B164-5, A127; Pr 4:297)

Special metaphysics is distinguished from General metaphysics in three ways:

1.  not entirely \`pure&rsquo; --- it depends on empirical concepts (i.e.
    <matter>, <mind>)
2.  extends only to objects of a particular form of intuition
    (e.g. space, time)
3.  depends on the applicability of mathematics

The third condition is especially noteworthy, because it closely connects
scientific status with mathematizability. WHy does Kant do this? Here is his
argument:

> I assert, however, that in any special doctrine of nature there can be only
> as much _proper_ science as there is _mathematics_ therein. For, according to
> the preceding, proper science, and above all proper natural science,
> requires a pure part lying at the basis of the empirical part, and resting
> on a priori cognition of natural things. Now to cognize something a priori
> means to cognize it from its mere possibility. But the possibility of
> determinate natural things cannot be cognized from their mere concepts; for
> from these the possibility of the thought (that it does not contradict
> itself) can certainly be cognized, but not the possibility of the object, as
> a natural thing that can be given outside the thought (as existing). Hence,
> in order to cognize the possibility of determinate natural things, and thus
> to cognize them a priori, it is still required that the _intuition_
> corresponding to the concept be given a priori, that is, that the concept be
> constructed. Now rational cognition through construction of concepts is
> mathematical. Hence, although a pure philosophy of nature in general, that
> is, that which investigates only what constitutes the concept of a nature in
> general, may indeed be possible even without mathematics, a pure doctrine of
> nature concerning _determinate_ natural things (doctrine of body or doctrine
> of soul) is only possible by means of mathematics. And, since in any
> doctrine of nature there is only as much proper science as there is a priori
> knowledge therein, a doctrine of nature will contain only as much proper
> science as there is mathematics capable of application there. (MFNS 4:470)

Cognizing a thing from its possiblity is cognizing it from its essence,[^fn:4] which
Kant identifies with the ground of the possibility of a thing.

> Essence is the first inner principle of all that belongs to the possibility
> of a thing. Therefore, one can attribute only an essence to geometrical
> figures, but not a nature (since in their concept nothing is thought that
> would express an existence). (MFNS 4:467, note)

Kant then contends that to cognize an essence (or ground of possibility) we
must advert to intuition, since the real or metaphysical possibility of a
thing cannot be determined solely from concepts. Conceptual representation is
necessary but not sufficient for cognition of essence. Kant then argues that
cognition of a thing from its ground of possibility (or essence) a priori is
tantamount to (or perhaps even identical with) a _mathematical construction_ of
that thing, since the thing is conceived in terms of features of pure
intuition, plus a concept, as, e.g., the cognition of the essence of a circle
is acheived in its construction in pure intuition as the &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; of a pure
line whose every point is equidistant from an arbitrary &ldquo;center&rdquo; point.

The importance of mathematical construction for science has a significant
consequence. Since Kant construes special metaphysics as being thoroughly
mathematically describable, he concludes that the object of inner sense (i.e.
the empirical mind or soul) is not going to provide the basis for a proper
science, because that object does not admit of mathematical construction.[^fn:5]
Hence, there is no special metaphysics of mental objects---i.e. psychology is
not a proper science.


## <span class="section-num">3</span> Hegel on the Systematicity of Science {#hegel-on-the-systematicity-of-science}

Like Kant, Hegel considers systematicity an essential aspect of science.
Indeed, as he puts it, &ldquo;The true shape in which truth exists can only be the
scientific system of that truth&rdquo; (PS 2:11, §5). This is a stronger claim than
that seemingly made by Kant, who argues only that for cognition to achieve the
status of a kind of scientific _knowing_ it must be part of a system and not
merely an aggregate of other cognitions (like a list of names in a phone
book). Further on in the preface Hegel clarifies, to some extent, why he holds
this stronger position:

> The true is the whole. However, the whole is only the essence completing
> itself through its own development. This much must be said of the absolute:
> It is essentially a _result_, and only at the _end_ is it what it is in truth.
> Its nature consists just in this: to be actual, to be subject, or, to be the
> becoming-of-itself. (PS 2:19, §20)

So truth is possible only in the system because truth _is_ (in some sense) the
system. There is, of course, the question of what this can mean. There are two
things that Hegel says that help us here. First, he says,

> In my view, which must be justified by the exposition of the system itself,
> everything hangs on grasping and expressing the true not just as _substance_
> but just as much as _subject_. (PS 2:18, §17)

The &ldquo;true&rdquo; is both substance and subject. Which is to say that the &ldquo;true&rdquo; is
_both_ the being that is known (substance) and the knower (subject). Hegel also
characterizes this as &ldquo;substance giving itself its self-consciousness, or, its
coming-to-be and its reflective turn into itself&rdquo; (PS 2:25, §28).

Second, Hegel characterizes &ldquo;truth&rdquo; as inherently dialectical insofar as it is
understood independent of &ldquo;absolute knowing&rdquo;. This means that what is &ldquo;true&rdquo;
develops in the course of the development of the system---or what seems to be
interchangble with this claim---the development of substance as subject. As
Hegel eloquently, if obscurely, puts it, &ldquo;truth is not a stamped coin issued
directly from the mint and ready for one’s pocket&rdquo; (PS 2:30, §39).

If truth is a kind of adequacy, conformity, or equality between knower and
known (or subject and substance), then there is the true only by virtue of an
entire determinate whole (i.e. the system) rather than any part of it. It is
only in the whole that the true as such can be comprehended. The parts of the
system in isolation give only unstable &ldquo;glimpses&rdquo; of the truth.

So Hegel has one very straightforward explanation of why science must be
systematic -- it is only the system as such that gives us truth, because only
the system as such is fully adequate to how things are.


### <span class="section-num">3.1</span> System and Purpose {#system-and-purpose}

Kant conceives of science in terms of the structure of the mind, and demands
that science must be organized according to an _idea_. This is very clearly a
position that Hegel incorporates into his own philosophy. He says, &ldquo;Science
may organize itself only through the proper life of the concept&rdquo; (PS 2:38,
§53). The concept sets an _end_ towards which it (i.e. all reality) strives to
develop. The concept organizes the system and expresses it. It is, as
possibility or _potentia_, the beginning of the system, and as fully determinate
or actual, the end of the system. It aims at an actualization of itself.

So Hegel takes from Kant the idea of science as systematic, and as connected
to reason, and also of being expressed in an idea that sets and end that
brings unity to the plurality of parts of the science.

Finally, &ldquo;the concept&rdquo; as Hegel understands it, exemplifies an important
feature of what Kant characterizes as intellectual intuition in the third
_Critique_. Kant characterizes _finite_ intellectual activity as \`discursive&rsquo; to
denote the manner in which our discursive understanding acts---viz. moving to
and fro, from part to part, in building a whole---rather than merely as a
synonym for \`conceptual&rsquo;, \`linguistic&rsquo;, or \`rational&rsquo;. It is this notion he
means to indicate in his characterization of the discursive intellect&rsquo;s
activity as that of &ldquo;running through&rdquo; and &ldquo;gathering together&rdquo; (A99)
representations. A non-discursive intellect, in contrast, exhibits a
whole-to-part grasp of its representations. This means that in an intellectual
intuition the content of any representational component is determined by the
content of the whole, which the intuitive intellect apprehends &ldquo;all at once&rdquo;
(_Religion Pölitz_ (1783/4), 28:1051) via grasp of what Kant sometimes calls a
&ldquo;synthetic universal&rdquo; (CPJ 5:407; cf. RP 28:1267; _Metaphysik L<sub>1</sub>_ 28:328; R
4270, 17:489 (1769--76); R6174 18:478 (1780s)). So the intuitive intellect is
non-discursive because it would not engage in the manner of part-to-whole
unification characteristic of discursive activity, instead representing all
things via its holistic comprehension of the synthetic universal.

> Our understanding, namely, has the property that in its cognition, e.g., of
> the cause of a product, it must go from the **analytical universal** (of
> concepts) to the particular (of the given empirical intuition), in which it
> determines nothing with regard to the manifoldness of the latter, but must
> expect this determination for the power of judgment from the subsumption of
> the empirical intuition (when the object is a product of nature) under the
> concept. Now, however, we can also conceive of an understanding which, since
> it is not discursive like ours but is intuitive, goes from the **synthetically
> universal** (of the intuition of a whole as such) to the particular, i.e.,
> from the whole to the parts, in which, therefore, and in whose
> representation of the whole, there is no **contingency** in the combination of
> the parts, in order to make possible a determinate form of the whole, which
> is needed by our understanding, which must progress from the parts, as
> universally conceived grounds, to the different possible forms, as
> consequences, that can be subsumed under it. (CPJ 5:407)

So the concept (or idea) is, like intellectual intuition, the determination of
the parts through the whole. Importantly, Kant equates this with _God&rsquo;s_
intellectual intuition. Hegel also equates the truth with God---&ldquo;God and God
alone is the truth&rdquo; (EL §1). Since the concept, in its full determinacy, is
the concept of the absolute and fully adequate to it, Hegel is in basic
agreement with Kant about God&rsquo;s intellectual intuition. Except in Hegel&rsquo;s
case reality (or &ldquo;the actual&rdquo;) is God thinking _itself_.[^fn:6]

[^fn:2]: See (APo. 72b21--23). For discussion see (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_13">Shields 2015</a>); cf. APo 71b33--72a5, Phys. 184a16--23, EN 1095b2--4 (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Aristotle and Irwin 1999, 4</a>).
[^fn:3]: Aristotle emphasizes the importance of definition in science. Understanding in science requires appeal to simple real deﬁnitions as opposed to compound nominal deﬁnitions. Compound deﬁnitions denote pseudo-individuals or kinds in the sense that they name items of different categories, most standardly substances and accidents. Hence “musician” is a compound deﬁnition denoting a kind of thing—a musical person—which does not have a genuine essence of its own. Musicians are not the kind of thing which are taken to have a common essence which explains why all things of that kind are the way they are (in contrast, say, to “human” or “animal”). No individual goes out of existence by ceasing to be musical (not even a musician, for there are, unfortunately, tone-deaf musicians) while a (human) musician clearly goes out of existence by ceasing to be human. Nominal deﬁnitions, in contrast, do allow for distinguishing genuine (as opposed to pseudo) individuals, but do so in a way that fails either to identify the principle attribute of the thing or effect a proper division of its genus. To use an example from Locke (E III.x.17, p.500, 5-10), we consider rational animal a better deﬁnition than two legged animal with broad nails because the latter, though (let us say) extensionally correct, fails either to capture the principle characteristic of being human (rationality) or effect a proper division of its genus (animal). For further discussion see (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">Ayers 1991b, 2:19</a> ff).
[^fn:4]: Note that Kant often distinguishes between an essence, so understood, and a _nature_, where the latter is the ground of the _existence_ (and not merely possibility) of a thing as determined by universal laws. A Kant puts it: > If the word nature is taken simply in its _formal_ meaning, where it means the > first inner principle of all that belongs to the existence of a thing then > there can be as many different natural sciences as there are specifically > different things, each of which must contain its own peculiar inner > principle of the determinations belonging to its existence. (MFNS 4:467; > cf. Pr 4:294, 318)
[^fn:5]: Why doesn&rsquo;t it? That is a subject of some controversy, but at least one reason seems to be that time has only one dimension, and so lacks sufficient mathematical structure for construction to be possible.
[^fn:6]: There is a non-accidental connection between Hegel&rsquo;s position here and Aristotle&rsquo;s position in _Metaphysics Lambda (XII)_ concerning the characterization of the divine mind as thought (νοῦς) thinking itself. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Aristotle 2016, 206 (1072</a> b)).
