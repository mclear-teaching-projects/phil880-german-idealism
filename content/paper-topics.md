Here are some possible topics for papers. You are welcome to write on something else
(or on some modified topic related to one of the options below), but please discuss
this with me first. The first draft of the paper is due **Monday, November 15<sup>th</sup>**. The
final draft is due **Monday, December 13<sup>th</sup>**.


## Kant {#kant}

-   Explain Kant&rsquo;s conceptions of the discursive and intuitive
    intellect. How are they related to one another? How are they different? In what
    sense might this distinction beg the question against the possibility of metaphysics?
-   Explain the role of the Metaphysical Deduction in Kant&rsquo;s overall argument in the
    _Critique of Pure Reason_. In what sense might the MD make traditional metaphysics
    impossible?
-   Kant rejects Spinoza&rsquo;s identification of God with nature. What is the basis of
    Kant&rsquo;s rejection? How might the Spinozist reply? Do any of Kant&rsquo;s commitments push
    him towards accepting Spinoza&rsquo;s view?


## Reinhold {#reinhold}

-   Explain Reinhold&rsquo;s principle of consciousness. Why does Reinhold think it necessary
    for philosophy? What objections are raised against it by Schulze or Fichte? Can
    Reinhold reply?


## Fichte {#fichte}

-   Fichte criticizes Reinhold for putting a fact rather than an act at the basis of
    his philosophical system. How should we understand this criticism? Explain the
    sense in which Fichte puts an act at the basis of philosophy.
-   Fichte distinguishes two philosophical systems---idealism and dogmatism. Explain
    this division. How does Fichte think we are to choose between them? Is there a
    rational basis for doing so? In what sense is idealism the expression of a &ldquo;higher&rdquo;
    form of human development?
-   In the _New Presentation_ writings Fichte contends that intellectual intuition is
    fundamental to the Wissenschaftslehre. What is intellectual intuition for Fichte?
    Is it the same notion as Kant&rsquo;s? Is there some other view in Kant that is a better
    fit for Fichte&rsquo;s conception of intellectual intuition?


## Schelling {#schelling}

-   What is &ldquo;construction&rdquo; and why does Schelling think it necessary for philosophy?
-   Explain the role of identity in Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy of identity


## Hegel {#hegel}

-   Explain the role skepticism plays in Hegel&rsquo;s philosophical project. In what sense
    is or isn&rsquo;t Hegel a &ldquo;critical&rdquo; philosopher?
-   What is Hegel&rsquo;s &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo; method for doing metaphysics?
-   How does Hegel&rsquo;s derivation of the categories differ from Kant&rsquo;s? Is one preferable
    to the other?
