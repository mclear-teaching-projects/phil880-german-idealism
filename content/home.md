This is the homepage for **PHIL 4/880** -- Classical German Idealism.

The class is a survey of “Classical” German Idealism, starting with Kant’s
publication of the _Critique of Pure Reason_ in 1781 and concluding with the first
part of Hegel’s _Science of Logic_ in 1812. Figures discussed include Kant, Jacobi,
Reinhold, Schulze, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. The general theme of the course
concerns the question, "How is inquiry into the nature of reality---i.e.
metaphysics---possible?". In asking this question we focus on four lines of thought
prominent in German Idealism—viz. Spinozism, skepticism, self-consciousness, and the
relationship between the senses and the intellect.
